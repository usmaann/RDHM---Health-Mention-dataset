"I quit my junk food addiction cold turkey last week, and I severely overestimated the detox period. Edit: Title was supposed to say ""Underestimated""

Edit 2: My first gold! Thank you kind stranger!

After years of eating tons of junk food and sugar, I decided to quit cold turkey a week ago. Since then, I've experienced extreme cravings, headaches, stomach aches and a drop in my mood. I seriously wasn't expecting all this to happen so suddenly. I didn't even realize I had an addiction. I thought I would miss it a little, but I wasn't expecting the whirlwind my body has gone through in the last 7 days. Here's hoping it gets better this week onwards.",0

"At 19yo, I am 6 months nicotine-free after 2 yrs of daily vaping. Unfortunately, vaping nicotine was a consistent habit I had picked up at the age of 17. I had several friends who were at the age of 18 or older and willing to buy nicotine juices/vaping devices for me. I was easily spending $50 or more per week on disposable vape pod devices to keep up my addiction until... I checked my 12-month credit card statement today, and it's officially been 6 months since I've made a purchase at the smoke shop!

Feeling very good to be freed of that mental and physical burden. I was regularly experiencing issues with high heart rate, chest congestion, etc. As a bonus, to those of you considering quitting, the money you save is pretty sweet too! :-)",2

I've battled alcohol and substance addiction, gone through so much in my life...didn't care about anything or anyone but myself, but I've finally put that behind me and reached a new milestone. I've successfully saved and out away my first $1000 toward my emergency fund. It's not much but I'm extremely proud of myself for finally changing..for finally finding enough purpose in my life to be motivated to do this. It feels SO good. I've came a long way you guys. My family doesn't really care, but I do. Just wanted to share something positive.",2

But through all that we still hold love for one another. I was actually waiting to buy our rings next week, when she pulled out two of her own last night and proposed to me! And I said yes! 

I cannot wait to see what our future brings. I am hopeful as we love each other very much. 

Thanks for reading this, I wish you all nothing but the best of lives! Because mines going pretty damn good, right now! 😁

"Going to be alone for my birthday, just looking for company My birthday is Tuesday, my partner is away to get help for addiction, I don't really have anyone I'm close to in my life. My parents are toxic people, they literally gloated when I told them my partner is off getting help. I have one close friend but I feel there is a distance between us, maybe it's in my head, but with covid, work, families it's hard to get together. I'l have chronic health issues so I'm being particularly careful.

Just thought I'd see how every one else is doing, if anyone else knows how any to make  new adult friends during covid and keep the friendships going. Especially if your a spoonie with anxiety like myself lol.",2

And now I haven’t ordered from them in a few weeks. I haven’t even thought about ordering. Maybe now I’ll finally complete my weight loss journey. This Chinese addiction has had me stuck at the same weight for several months, but this time it’s really over. I’m happy.",0
"Nowadays, with a conversation around video games and the addiction made me wonder why young people get addicted to video games? 
My take is Video games simulate responsibility by giving you a goal and making you solely responsible for realising that goal. Video games are about heroism and success, which young men absolutely crave and cant find in their lives.",0
"I only ever drink or smoke socially to avoid falling victim to addiction From what I have learned from the very little experience I have, one should only drink or smoke when at least one other person agrees to do it with them. I think this is the best way to reap the advantages of having a good social life while also avoiding falling victim to addiction.

I know nicotine addiction can get out of hand very fast and smoking is bad even if you do it occasionally, I still think with this rule you can 'enjoy life' while living relatively healthy life.",2
"Addicted to Bubble wrap I know in am not the only one who finds amusement in bursting bubble wraps, oddly satisfying.

It started out when I used to pop the bubble wraps used in the packaging of the stuffs I buy online..But now I go to home depot and sometimes usps or Walmart  to buy bubble wrap and pop them before going to bed or when I am bored.

 I am afraid it ll turn into an addiction since I can't sleep without popping a few bubbles. Just thinking of bursting bubble wraps calms me down when I am nervous.
 Its very silly but i am doing my best to minimize it so it doesn't become a permanent addiction since it cost around  $17 to $20 for a roll which last for about a week or 2.",0
"My grandpa got hit by a speeding deputy My grandpa had just gone through rehab and cured his smoking/drug addiction. He was turning his life around, when he got hit by a car. There was a 20 year old deputy playing on his laptop while driving over the speed limit. My grandpa was on his bike. When he got hit he broke and dislocated his shoulder, and was brought to a hospital. His back was also messed up, and he couldn’t do much because his shoulder occasionally fell out of place, which hurt a lot.",2
"I have an addiction to pornagraphy and tonight I had a small win. I am on mobile, so apologies for formatting

I was on my way to my room, and I as I got to the doorway I grabbed the edge of the door frame and held my self there for ten minutes, I was a having a mental battle and convincing myself not to go do it.

I felt as if I couldn't move my feet no matter how much I tried and after another few minutes I managed to convince myself to take a step toward the downstairs, it was harder than I expected and my breath was quickening and I felt like my legs were concreted to the floor.

It was such a tiny win tonight, but I was clean for 7 days on record until yesterday, and something broke in me and I was given strength to resist by the grace of God.

To the people out there who deal with addictions, you are a trooper and loved in the eyes of God, keep finding those small victories where you can, and if you've read this far God bless you.",0
"March is my month! I made a promise to myself that in this month of March, I would start getting my shit together. What that mostly entails is eating better, going to the gym more, getting on top of my schoolwork, and beating my p0rn addiction. I'm already on the right track because I went to the gym today.

It's gonna take a lot of work, but I really want to try to do this. I really want to better myself and be a little more content with life. If I can do all these things I will definitely be a lot closer to my goals in life.",0
"Has anyone else developed a major online shopping addiction during quarantine? I sure have. To be fair, the money I'm saving on gas and food by staying in and eating in means that I'm putting more into my savings account each month than I was before, but man, I really cannot stop buying stuff online that I don't need.

Are you doing the same? What are you buying?",0
"An old friend who was suffering from drug addiction hit me up after he became clean Title pretty much says it all. I've had a pretty rough start to the new year and I've been pretty depressed.

My friend has been fairly distant over the past year and a half or so, mainly due to the aforementioned addiction issues, but he just popped right back into my life right when I needed him and man it feels good. Told me all about his journey and how he really missed me, and now that he's clean it's just nothing but great times.

We played through the entire Halo Reach campaign on legendary the other day and I don't think I've ever been that happy in my life.",2
"Getting rid of an addiction For as long as I remember I have had a eating addiction, I just couldn’t help it I would stuff my face as soon as I would get back and if I didn’t I would start feeling nauseous but due to certain going-ons I have started to reduce what I eat and I have started to get better at controlling myself and I just thought I would try posting on here",0
"Yesterday I realized I may be addicted to games So I enjoyed my nightly gaming session as pretty much every evening yesterday and after reading a comment about alcohol addiction in another subreddid (the user pointed out, that he steadily drank more and more, without realizing, but needed it to keep going) I reflected on myself and realized that I had the almost same behaviour, but only with gaming. 

What started as a fun hobby to do when nothing that interested me was on TV turned into almost 1 1/2 full time jobs (120h spent over two weeks only ""in game""). And even when I'm not playing games, they are always on my mind by browsing the respective subreddits or watching gameplay.

So today I unplugged my harddrive and am only going to reconnect it once my exams are over in about two months. While freeing, it also feels weird, like cutting out a huge part of who I am and pretty much my main (and only) hobby.

I really hope this post is in accordance with rule 2.",0
"You know what's an underrated feeling? Dropping sugar addiction. I'm sitting here drinking cold lemon water and eating raw carrots, celery and blueberries and they taste DELICIOUS.

"Just drank water casually for the first time in my life I’m 18 and for years I’ve been drinking pop. Like literally straight out of 2-liters, at least one a day for about 5 days, then next week I’d do it again. My body has no health problems of any kind and my metabolism is crazy.

Recently, I’ve been drinking water because pop isn’t good for your skin. So I’ve been drinking water to clear my acne that I’ve had for about 5 years. My skin is tough to clear, so I’ve decided to do my prescription and a diet change.

Just today, I drank my water, bottled without wanting to spit it out. I felt literally nothing and I only realized when I drank the bottle in under 30 seconds. It made me feel proud, like my pop addiction is fading away.  Pop was like crack, and here I am moving on. I feel good right now.",2
"I think I've quit video games for good now but now I am confronted with boredom I have no interest in playing video games today and I think it will last indefinitely. Which is weird because I used to play a few hours a day. LOL mostly and MTG pc games. But I gave up on MTG because Green decks are op. If you can't admit that then what kind of a person are you?  
So I had been playing LOL exclusively and was pretty decent at it. But maybe a week or so ago I did terribly in every game. Then the other day I RQed and uninstalled and I'm really glad I did. That game was a black hole in my life that is no longer there. I suddenly realized that life exists for a few more hours a day. Which is where I'm at now and I'm trying to find something to do to unwind at the end of the day.    
I guess I posted here looking for a conversation or something. Not sure, but if you want to talk about pc gaming, gaming addiction or choosing not to play at all HMU.",0

"How much are you addicted to social media? I was extremely addicted to Instagram. I used to spend hours just scrolling through feeds. Later, i realised i was spending too much of time using instagram. It was just me liking pictures of people who i don't even so. I realised it's just a waste of time and decide to limit my ig usage. But, as i spend most of my time indoors, i don't have anything to do. So, i moved to twitter because it's better then ig and very informative as well. 

Now my ig addiction is over. I spend time on twitter only. I am not addicted to Twitter but i am limiting my usage time because its also a social media. 

How much time do you spend on social media?",0
"I’ve been sober from methamphetamine for one year today!! A year ago, I would have never dreamed that I’d be living in my own apartment, completely self-sufficient, with a new (to me) car and a great job where I have a good reputation. Life is so sweet, and I am grateful to be alive and clean.

If any of you are struggling with a go-fast addiction, I highly recommend checking out r/StopSpeeding. It was my rock throughout this year; a great source of unfailing love, encouragement, and support. 💛 One day, one minute at a time!",2

"Having bad habits will always put you at a disadvantage, because you'll never be at the top of your game Because these habits can very likely turn into full-blown addictions and even if not, you always have a dependency on that habit when you're stressed. You're not your best when you're a slave to something. Also, there's the guilt that keeps messing with you.",0

"Addiction sucks If you are struggling with addiction there is always hope. If you have a child or loved one struggling please know that there is a future.  When a mama cries every time she hears an ambulance siren and thinks her time has come to face the loss of a child, I pray for you. Everyone has value and is a precious child of God. I struggle daily with an opiate addicted son. I know his struggle is worse than mine because he gets up everyday facing demons that I can’t imagine.",1
"I'm finally happy after 25 years of drug addiction. I recently just turned 40, had multitude of jobs and relationships.

Is this what normal is?",2
"I’ve been nicotine free for 6 months now. It’s nothing super crazy but I realized that today marks the 6 month point since I quit smoking and dipping. I don’t miss cigarettes but MAN do I miss dip hahaha. I’ll never go back though. I’ve just noticed too many positive changes in my lifestyle since quitting. Anyone else out there who is trying to quit or struggling with it just keep pushing yourself because once you are free of that addiction it is a million times better.

Edit: Wow thank you guys all for the support and good conversation. And thank you for the gold! I’m glad that this is such a great community! You guys have made me feel really good.",2

"Non addicted smoker So I never smoked at school when it was ""cool"" to do and gradually started at 19 when out in pubs. I smoked only drinking, then eventually would smoke at work as well. I used to say I'm not addicted and my dad would say you are all smokers say that. However I really wasnt, I would stop smoking at work and even all together for months but would then smoke when out drinking.
I have never felt that I have to smoke or need nicotine, i tend to smoke out of awkwardness and anxiety, a reason to step outside or to look busy.
I just realised as i havent been the pub i havent smoked for 5 weeks without the urge at all, i know i will smoke on the weekend as I'll be drinking at a wedding. Anyone else like this, i think i am very fortunate as addiction is terrible. I know people will say if your not addicted then just stop, my mom says it all the time.",2
"Since the birth of our second son a week ago my wife and I have a new addiction... any tv show with Gordon Ramsay. We are loving Gordon right now.

Lol we have really bonded over this. Oh and our new son too. Lol. We went nuts when we found out he was going to be on Hot Ones! Do you guys love Chef Ramsay too?

"How do you get over an addiction? So I'm getting married in 12 weeks and 5 minutes.

I've decided to stop drinking coke in the house till then. I go through about 1.5l of diet coke a day and have done for years.

I told my fiance this earlier and said ""of course I'll finish what's already in the house first"" and I realised that's literally what alcoholics and drug addicts say.

Luckily the only negative impact of drinking diet coke is my health/weight but I genuinely don't know how to overcome this addiction it's been so many years!

Any advice?",2
"I just got out of rehab and I feel amazing Holy shit. It's crazy how good I feel right now. And it's not just about working through my addiction, there's stuff in rehab that could be beneficial to anyone. Intensive therapy and what not.

Just wanted to share.",2
"I can finally say I love my job About a month ago I started working in the drug and alcohol treatment field. This is the first time I've ever worked in this field, and I can't imagine ever wanting to do anything else. As someone also in recovery (working on 15 months sober) it is truly an inspiration to see others grow in early sobriety. My coworkers and bosses are all truly amazing people as well. 

My life has really changed for the better recently, and this job is just one more great thing to literally fall into my lap. Doing the right things has finally started to pay off. 

To those out there who may be struggling, with addiction or anything at all, don't ever be afraid to reach out for help. I'm so glad I did.

Sorry if this is a little boring, but I just wanted to share this with random internet strangers.",1
"Just wanted to tell all those people in recovery from addictions, you're doing great! You got this and your loved ones are so proud of you. I'm proud of you. Work in a shop, served a bloke the other day who was dressed in a suit. I mentioned he looked dapper and he responded 'Thanks, I've just been to my AA meeting, I shared today.' So I gave him a round of applause and said I was so happy to hear that.

My step-dad is giving up smoking after 45 years. He used to be on 3 packs (60) a day, or more. Now he's been smoke free for 4 months. I love him to bits and I'm so proud of him.

So if there's anyone recovering from smoking/drinking/drug/gambling/whatever, I just want you to know, you can do it!",1
"Is there such thing as using Reddit too much, i feel like a suffer from a 'Reddit addiction' I joined Reddit 2 weeks ago and i've been on and off it continuously, it's been so interesting learning about different subreddits and reading different opinions etc, but i feel like i go on it too much, is there ever a limit to how much you can enjoy social media?",0
"Struggling with quitting addictions Hey people!
Backstory is i am 23, i smoked weed and cigarettes everyday and would play alot of video games to take up the time. I have now started full time work but i decided on quitting my addictions because wasnt worth the waste of money or just general health and mind. But now on my weekends i just dont know what todo, im to start working out, but i need to learn how to make new groups of friends to occupy time or even how to make myself comfortable being alone. Anythoughts and also what did you do today?",2
"I made a self-care plan When I had a panic attack recently and today I felt anxious, I realized that I need to focus more on my health. I have had a bad social media and Internet addiction for a long time. I now try to focus on things, that are actually good for me. I'll focus on writing, reading and baking. I used to be a bookworm before my depression worsened, and writing and baking have been my interests in adult life.",0
"I just wanted to say, I'm beating back an addiction. Not a serious one but buying clothes and shoes has taken over me for the last 2 years. I have been working my first real job for 2 years since leaving university, and while I know this is my first real job, i used it as a licence to get all the things I wanted. It has not been great, but I'm finally moving past it and admitting it as a problem so I can move forward and do something better with my money.


I don't think this is quite serious enough to share elsewhere on Reddit, and I didn't want to talk to any friends etc because it hasn't ruined any relationships, just the relationship with my wallet.",0
"Learning to drink in my 30’s. Long story short I have a lot of alcoholics in my immediate family.  For that reason and that I had a group of friends that didn’t really drink I’ve only started to explore alcohol recently.  

I’m experimenting to see what I like.  I love rum and Coke, and I’m dipping my toe into whiskey.  Margaritas are also great.  I watched Zodiac the other night and it inspired me to make blue lagoons tonight, they turned out decent.  

Wondering if there are other people who got into drinking after their 20’s, or deal with a fear of alcoholism even when it’s not your addiction?  Any good drinks I should try?  I’m still fairly anti beer.",2
"I finished a poem that's been rolling around in my head for a couple years now I'd like to share. 

It's called A Walk Through the Night. 

-----

Of men that burn with toil and turn-- their vacant stares at night-- a few lie still with silence filled, a fury with its might. 

A broken rest, unwelcome jest, the thoughts that apparate. A violent pulse at once convulse, and start to separate.

Undo the few who carry through with simple past affliction. And sorry still, their indifferent mill, with pacified addiction.

Of matters more and most to him, the truth is evident. Deceit and lies, destructive skies , disquised as parliament. The night has come and gone again, a feeling lost of touch. The journey stretches, no relent, a distance far too much.",1
"I cut an addiction out of my life today. For the past few weeks, I'd been completely addicted to a free video game. It's one of those games where you don't have to pay to win, but you have to grind to hell and back to get even a little bit of progress. Trying for that bit of progress consumed my life. Every time I sat down at the computer, I automatically opened up Steam and started playing - at the detriment to my work, my school, and anything else I wanted to do. I started dropping my other hobbies, and even neglected a few passions of mine, like creative writing. Today, I finally decided that enough was enough, and I deleted it off my computer. It feels like a weight is off my shoulders now, and it feels like I have so much more time to spend now that it's not consuming every free moment.",0
"What's your addiction? It could be anything. Books, movies, a certain tv show. A certain food or drink. An activity. A person?

"Is it worth is to stop smoking? I know everyone here has probably heard the stories of people making miraculous recoveries from nicotine addiction, but i dont see the point myself
Backstory:
I started smoking cigs a few years ago (im 18 now). I often get very angry and frustrated with my parents and sister (almost daily) and sneak out of my house and smoke to calm me down so i can sleep (the threat of cancer has never bothered me that much).  due to both COVID and other factors i couldnt buy cigs recently. 
I have noticed it helped prevent bad breath and toothdecay as well as saving me money, but I go to bed almost every day frustrated and angry now that I don't have my cigs. I wanted to ask if it is worth quiting and having more sleepless nights or if u guys think it isnt worth it.",2
"I have quit 3 games that I was addicted to. I feel great, but I have some free time I have yet to fill now. I had been playing these games about a year or two now. All of them required daily logins to get some kind of reward. I remember being stressed about missing a day and losing the ultimate rewards that required a certain number of logins. It has been two months since I just quit all 3 of them, several friends messaged me and asked if I was okay (actually, it was kind of rude of me to leave without a message). These messages meant a lot, but I made up my mind and I wont be returning. Now, I still play video games, but they dont control my life any longer. I still couldnt shake that ""I forgot to do something"" feeling, but every day I keep remembering that I quit those games, and it puts a smile on my face. It's not like gaming is bad, but some games indeed have addiction mechanisms attached.",0
"Does anyone else feel like people severely exaggerate technology and social media addiction? I mean, don't get me wrong - there are clearly cases where it is as bad as they say, but while reading the comments on that Facebook documentary that hit the front page I noticed people going on about how everyone in their life couldn't bear to get off social media or peel their eyes off their phones at all. They seem to believe that we're in a dystopian future that's hardly any different from those presented in all those books we read in high school English, yet in my experience those sorts of people are far from the norm. They are by all means a minority, at least in my life, and it feels like people are just fearmongering.",0
Is this an addiction to porn? Everything I see turns me on.

Porn doesn’t turn me on I just find it funny but I can’t stop watching it. HELP ME,0

"How to help with a gaming addiction If you’re on this sub there’s a good chance you play games and some of us are addicted and I have a way to help.

I was playing games 10+ hours a day and it was getting in the way of my life. This one is probably very relatable, but it was effecting my school grades and work habits. I was having fun, but if I continued, I probably wouldn’t have gotten into High school and being a virtual student doesn’t make it any easier. What I found is a very tough thing to do but really made school a breeze, Limit your Time! I am only allowing myself to 1 hour a day of device time and weekends 3 hours a day, split up into 1.5 hours in the day and 1.5 at night. It may seem difficult at first but thats okay! If you need to restrict the time to something easier, maybe you set yourself to 7 hours a day and work your way to lower times. If you need help/advice, dm’s are open!

I really hope that you all out there find this helpful, and have a great day!",0

"A little irrelevant, but stopping my addiction to horror kind of changed me Ok so I used to really like horror and stuff like that, but it messed with my head because I couldn’t go downstairs at night with the lights off, it even got to the point where I didn’t feel safe leaving my room at night and I even saw faces and stuff of whatever horror I’d watched that day when I closed my eyes. A week or two ago I decided to stop watching horror so much and now I can actually get to sleep peacefully at night, I can leave my room and go downstairs actually feeling alright. Sounds a little childish now I put it down but whatever, it’s a change at least.",0

Following a 4 hour investigation of the incident,  I was allowed back into the home, after everyone left I went to her room discovering two freezer bags,gallon sized full of various pain killers and sedatives along with muscle relaxers and ADHD meds for the next 3 months I spent very little time sleeping or sober, there's my confession I will answer any questions asked.",2

"Dealing with many years of Adderall addiction I have been addicted to adderall for 7 years. I absolutely love it, but I know I need help. I can take up to 100 to 140 mg a day (with a day break in between bc I'm absolutely geeked.)

Withdraw from it is severely hard for me as I struggle with being a normally fatigued person who struggles with deep rooted, long term depression. I am not a functioning member of society when I'm going through withdraw and have to plan my dosages out so I can properly withdraw on days I dont have responsibilities. 

I am ashamed on my addiction and no one close to me knows I battle with this as I hide it really well. I'm at the point where I want to reach out for advice and a shoulder as I deal with this completely alone, but struggle with the thought of getting help. Any and all positive feedback is welcomed and appreciated. Thank you very much",2

"I found $100 on the ground and used it to get out of a gambling addiction I was on vacation at a resort and I spotted a silver credit card on the ground in a sitting area with nobody around. I walked over to see what it was, looked down at it and noticed it was a $100 prepaid visa card, then covered it with my foot for about 20 minutes thinking about what to do and waiting for someone to walk back to retrieve it.

Nobody ever came and I asked front desk if anyone had asked about missing a visa card.

So once I got home from the vacation I used the money to gamble, and it just happened I was a hundred dollars in the hole from gambling. Oh yeah I am also kinda young so this is a lot of money to me. I paced myself well with the money until I started rage betting. Got down to $20 and I was pissed, went all in and ended up winning $240 on that and I haven’t gambled since.",0

"My fiance has a drug addiction and I feel powerless In the year we've been together, my fiance has always been open with me about his cocaine use. He wants to party once a week after work and I made my peace with it because I want him in my life.



It was fine at first but lately he's started skipping work to get high. After he skipped three times in a month, I told him that I wanted a future with him and there's no future in his behavior.




He constantly complains about the drugs making him feel sick and ugly, and he asked for my help to keep him away from it this week. He told me to take his phone (I did) and not leave his side (I didn't). His friends acted like I was being controlling and I didn't correct them.

"Addicted to hookers It all started when I was 16. I used to masturbate a lot, and I got really curious and wanted to try sex for the first time. I found the website Backpage before it got shut down, and saw the average price for sex was around 60-80$. My parents have me 10-20$ every week for food, sometimes I brought lunch to school. The days I was supposed to eat out, I just starved on purpose so I can stack up the money to be able to afford my first hooker. 

So the day finally came, where I had enough money to buy my first hooker. I was nervous at first. I told her I was 16, she said that she didn't care as long as I had the money. We had the sex and after that I have been really addicted to sex. 

For the past 2 years I have been visiting hookers to satisfy my lust needs. I have a problem and I need to stop. Fortunately I haven't gotten an STD, since I always use condoms. I've probably spent over 20k in total on my addiction and I am starting to regret it.",0
"I told my best friends wife that he had a secret gambling addiction. So 3 days ago i broke my friends trust.

I tried my best to keep the secret, but the guy has 2 kids (whom i am Godfather to), and if he kept this up he would be financially ruined (he is betting a huge amount).

So I told his wife.  She promised not to reveal I told her and she said she would pretend she found out another way.

But I still feel guilty about breaking his trust.  Maybe ill tell him i told her.  It would be the honorable thing to do.",2

Me, a few years ago, being this desperate teenager who wanted to be cool and couldn't afford cigarettes himself stole from him pretty regularly. I can't really recall how much it was, but it was a good amount. 
He found out after a few months, because I always stole just a few cigarettes so he wouldn't notice and this one time I got greedy and stole a package, which as I said he noticed.

My mother would often ask me to visit him in the hospital but I would always refuse because I thought playing my game was more important than letting a dying man see me one last time.

I feel like it is an unnecessary precaution. Your average attendee to the hospital isn't going to become addicted to prescription opioids from several days of Oxycodone post trauma or surgery. The seniors who I have spoken to attribute their choice as a decrease in undesirable side effects from morphine derivates.

"does anyone else know they have several things wrong with their mental health and brains but won't bother to see or pay for a therapist? i have issues. severe anxiety since childhood (i believe this level of anxiety over a long period of time has significantly impacted my brain), depression, maybe autism, short term memory issues, addiction issues, some OCD tendencies, CPTSD, selective mutism, and maybe aspergers. i dont want to pay for therapy but also i feel can't tell people what my issues are and how to accomodate me if i dont have any diagnoses. i also have issues keeping doctors appointments and i have ghosted doctors and therapists in the past.",2
"I think I have a shoplifting addiction. Lately when I go out it's hard for me to not steal. It's either impulsive and in the moment or I go to a store with a plan to shoplift. I don't believe its for the rush of getting away with stealing (I do get one but it comes with so much anxiety) but I use materialism as a coping mechanism as items tend to bring me joy. I usually steal things I really want, like clothes or little things here and there or snacks. I figured I'd be saving money on all my stupid impulse buys to get the 'rush' from that. Yesterday I put on an expensive cardigan and some sunglasses at Target and walked out while wearing them and when I got home after the high wore down I was sweating from anxiety because I felt like such a horrible person, I don't want any retail employees to get in trouble cause of me. I know I'm just going to keep doing it again and again and I wanna stop.",2

At first I said I wouldn't buy it myself. Then I said I wouldn't use it at home. Finally I said I won't use it to the point of an overdose anymore.

How did this happen? I wasn't even interested in cocaine until I was pushed to try it at a party.",2

Spent Christmas alone crying in my apartment. Since then, I got a job and rekindled my friendship with my best friend that fell apart last year.

The last few months I've been ok: working, exercising, eattng well. Tonight however, everything fell apart mentally. I felt cold, everything felt slow, it was hard to breath. I started crying and couldn't stop. I got my rope and started looking up how to tie it again...

Thats because something got in the way of its growth while it was growing /had trauma. These fruits have over 2 times the amount of nutrition as a normal undamaged piece of fruit. Because its had to build and collect more resources and strength to grow! And thats the same as humans!

We all go through pain but aslong as you don't give up/become a total asshole lol. And just accept your condition. You WILL recover and come out the other side of it a more beautiful person!

"Are people with depression prone to addiction to things like energy drinks? It sounds kind of immature to claim an actual addiction to energy drinks but its something that ive struggled with and I've wondered if there's been any studies about this or any thoughts on it in general.

I've never been diagnosed with anything and am not claiming to have any illness myself. But on days where I have trouble getting out of bed, just feel drained altogether, and have trouble mentally functioning all the way I end up drinking an excessive amount of energy drinks without even noticing and it does actually tend to make a difference.

Any input is appreciated",1

"Memory loss due to trauma? Dear all,

I have a question regarding memory loss and whether it is effected by childhood trauma and depression.

A bit about me: I was around 10 years old when I first started to get sexually abused by a family member and managed to tell someone some time after. After 10 years old, I remember having a masturbating and porn addiction but that’s all I can remember. I experienced other events of unwanted sexual contact throughout my life. I did see a therapist around 19yrs old but it didn’t work for me. I’m now at 22. However I have terrible memory loss to the extent that I forget things said 10 seconds ago, my life up to 18yrs old is a complete blur and I hardly remember anything and I have no childhood memories at all that I can tell about it. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it normal?",2

Genetic? Vitamins and mineral matter?

"I am allergic to my sister (literally, no jokes) I just figured it out. 

Since the last 5-6 months, I have been having a problem of intense itching all over my body, mainly in my hands and feet, and especially during night time. It's the kind of itch that you can not scratch.  About 2 months ago, I moved out for a job. The problem was gone and I did not think about it anymore. I visit my home on the weekends, and started noticing that the problem was back again whenever I was at home. This went on for 6-7 weekends. Then one night, it didn't happen, and guess what - my sister was not at home that day. 


It all makes sense now. The reason it was only at night time was that I was usually busy throughout the day and only spent time with her at night before going to bed. 

I did an experiment just now, I went to her room and sat beside her (it's afternoon), and the itching started after 10 minutes. Confirmed. Oh my god. How do I even google something like this?",2
"I've been allergic to cats my entire life. This little bastard is worth the benadryl. I'm 29 and have been allergic to cats my entire life.  My eyes turn into itchy tomatoes and I break out in hives.  I came to visit my sister two weeks ago and she forgot to mention her roommate had gotten a cat...

The first week was hell.  I was popping benadryl like Tic Tacs.

However...it's week two and I'm showing no symptoms at all!  The cat and I have even become bros.

I'll always be a dog person but this is the first time in my life I've been able to hang out with a cat.",2
"I am getting the Covid vaccine in 6 days! I am so excited! I feel so fortunate that as an essential worker I am able to receive the vaccine in this early phase. I am filled with gratitude and needed to express my overwhelming excitement and relief since I have a few underlying conditions.

EDIT: I just got my vaccine! They started doing walk-ins today. I came in on my day off to get it. After the vaccine they gave me a timer. We have to stay here for 15 minutes to make sure we don’t have an allergic reaction.",1
"I befriended an abandoned house cat and I'm in love. So my parents have a barn and barn cats. Well I was walking up my steps to the front door and one came up to me. She is super affectionate and just wanted inside. I stayed with her for a few but I couldnt let her inside because of my dogs and allergic mother.

Fast forward to tonight. I crack my window open because it's hot in my room.  About twenty minutes later I hear meowing behind me. Turn around and she's squeezed in through my window. She was kinda scared at first but she is now sleeping on my lap. I'm in love. I really wish I could keep her but I don't have my own place at the moment. Gonna try and find a friend who would want to take her in. Currently trying to think of Warcraft related names for her.",2
"I WANT A cat hi everyone. i just want to know what you would do in this situation.
i love cats so much and i want to get one so bad but one of my best friends is severely allergic to them and would literally never come over again. also she just doesn’t like cats in general so even if she wasn’t allergic she probably wouldn’t come around it lol. 
so my question is...... have cats and be happy or have best friend come over and be happy",2
"I'm dogsitting, discovered I was allergic to dogs I've had dogs sporadically throughout my life and decided I'd help out a friend, I'm pretty good with dogs and my friend needed somebody to watch his pitbull puppy. Lazy thing, lays in my bed or ontop of me all day. Problem is I'm aparrently REALLY allergic to dogs. When I had a dog when I was younger, I assumed it was my pollen allergies, but now I'm very aware that I'm allergic, and I'm feeling pretty sick. It'll be okay, and the dog is still a bunch of fun, I just really don't like being allergic to dogs. Does anyone have any similar stories?",2
"Peanuts inside of a grilled cheese? Hey guys. I just had an interesting Omegle session. There's a spy question mode on the site where you can type a question and watch as 2 strangers discuss whatever it was you typed.

So, me being a silly boy, I decided to ask the following...

""Should I put peanuts in my grilled cheese to add some crunch? I know the toasted bread is crunchy already but I need that extra crunch you know.""

I sat back in disbelief as I read two particular strangers' responses. Both of them agreed that this weird combination sounds really good.

So now, I'm like, ""Wait, are they serious?"" And they left me wondering, what if it actually does taste good?

Unfortunately, I'm allergic to peanuts so I'm going to have to use a substitute. Almonds maybe?

If anyone actually wants to try this out for themselves, please feel free to let me know how it went. If you don't plan on eating this anytime soon, let me know what you think about how this combination sounds.",2
"I don't like pineapples, in fact, I am slightly allergic to them. What is this subreddit doing to provide space for people like me? As a subreddit that prides itself on being inclusive, I am *highly* offended by this assumption that I, too, am a pineapple lover. A pineapple killed my family in cold blood, and then stole my friends from me by dazzling them with fast cars and money. Whenever I see pineapples on a pizza I burst into rage and have to be forcibly restrained by nearby authorities, whenever I sleep I am taunted with pineapple-filled nightmares. I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.

Edit: due to this all spiralling out of control, /r/pineapplehate has been made, *most likely* by /u/Alpy94. Though I do not wish to be a 'hate' subreddit by nature, if only by name - thus we must only use this sub to discuss our own pineapple-caused tragic backstories, and not to specifically target pineapples for the sake of making fun of them. We are the victims, not the oppressors.",2
"Digestive System is reaaaaalllly important  I grew up thinking the brain and heart were the most important but seriously as I'm aging I'm at the mercy of my digestive system more and more.

Feeling a little heartburn? Can't go on cars, planes, boats, etc due to nausea. Digested, pooped and feeling fine? No motion-sickness.

Feeling a little ill? That pork/egg/random fruit I ate is going to give me hives. No, I'm not usually allergic to it, yes I can go back to eating it.

Low serotonin? It's probably your gut!

Getting heartburn a few times spiraled into me needing emergency surgery (unrelated to the digestive system). It was the first to know something was wrong with me.

Take care of your gut kids.",2
"I'm allergic to seafood I'm allergic to seafood, I just can't eat it, it's also difficult to eat, like the fish sharp bones and you have to peel the pawn's skin.

My airways close up with strawberries and bananas.  Fish gives me hives. I have been tested for allergies and am allergic to mold, dogs and cats, fresh cut grass, oak trees (and other trees). I recently learned that I have a citric acid intolerance. What are you allergic to? ",2
"Allergic to potatoes of all things! Just gotta get this one out there.

Does anyone else have a [nightshade](http://www.diagnosisdiet.com/nightshades/) allergy? Because I do! If I have potatoes or potato starch I get violently ill.  It started when I was about 29ish.  

Most of the time...almost all of the time, it's no big deal.  I can't have french fries, I rarely have pizza, potato chips, etc.  I know those salty pieces of amazingness are pretty incredible, but they are typically 'junk' food.  

Here's the irritating thing about being allergic to potatoes...is the potato starch.  On shredded cheese that comes in a bag, that dusty stuff that keeps the cheese from sticking together? Potato starch! Among many many other things.  

Oi vey! Anyone else have this allergic irritant? lol!",2
"Allergic boyfriend and my cats I have two cats. They're the best and I love their company. I've had them for a few years since they were kittens. 

I also have a boyfriend whom I can really see a future with. We live in the same area, we have a life together and we're progressing toward long term stuff. Blah blah. 

The problem is that my boyfriend is rediculously allergic to cats. If I don't wash my hair before we hang out, he gets itchy and sneezey. 

How do we life? Anyone have suggestions for options?",2
"I had a really fun night with my coworker Last night I decided to stick around until a couple after closing so I could spend time with my coworker and it was amazing. The work itself sucked, we were painting the store and I found out ill allergic to goo gone (cleaner sold in America) and got a ton of cuts all over my hands. However it was all worth it cause me and her just spent like 7 hours doing random shit, talking and having a good time. We painted the store, ourselves, and even hid our handprints and initials under the counter. I'm too shy to actually ask her out so I'm taking this as a major win. Anyway that's all, I got no one to tell this to so I figured I'd put it on here, peace",2
"So I found out I was allergic to cats. For context I'm 20 and male. 
I was hanging out at a friend's house and got there before he did so his roommate let me in. This roommate has an adorable cat named George. I've been over to his house before and have pet George but not like this time 
He jumped up on me and laid down so I started petting him for about 30 minutes. As time went on I started to get a little itchy and eventually started feeling bumps on my body. So I'm like ""huh guess I'm allergic""
Until a few days ago I didn't think I had any allergies. But I guess cats are one of them. 
You peeps ever have anything like that happen?",2
"Cat language Hello! I have never owned a cat, so I don't know much about them. In the last year or so, I've become friends with a neighbour's cat. I talk to him and give him ear scratches and he comes to my door now to say hi.

It's becoming autumn here in Vancouver and the weather is getting cooler. I just heard a meow from my front door so I went to say hi to my kitten friend. I opened the door and he just walked right in and went directly for my bedroom. I should mention that I'm severely allergic to cats, so I was like....uh no.

He was walking around like he was looking for something but he's never been in my home! What do you think he was searching for? I thought maybe he was cold, but it was as if he was searching for someone or something. 

If you understand cat language, can you tell me what this kitty was doing? Just looking around, trying to find a warm place?",2
"I don't usually like cats but this one cat is changing my mind I'm very much a dog person, and growing up I always stayed away from cats because my mom and sister were extremely allergic and even a little bit of hair on me would sometimes set them off. Plus the cats that my friends had were always quite skittish and stand-offish, so I've always thought ""screw cats, dogs are a thousand times cooler"".
Right now I'm staying in my boyfriend's family home for the holidays, and they have a cat. I keep telling this little furball that i dont like cats, i like dogs, but he keeps following me around the house, sleeping on my stomach when im taking a nap, scratching at whatever room im in to be let in and rubbing against my leg. Hes a naturally friendly cat, but my boyfriend says he's being unusually friendly to me. This cat is very cute and i like him a lot, gahhhh my heart",2
"Thinking about getting a dog even though I am allergic to them Hey guys! How is everyone doing?

So I just moved into my new place and realized that I'm living in a fairly large space for only myself. I have always loved dogs and have always dreamt about having a furry friend for myself. The one problem is, I am allergic to dogs. I get the typical red eyes, scratchy throat, red bumps on my body, sneezing, etc. However, I have heard that if you live with the same dog and take medication, your body eventually gets accustomed to that dog. 

Does anyone have personal experience with this? I love dogs so much and really want a buddy of my own, but I don't know if the shots will cost me my bank and if my allergies will ever subside. I also would want a non hypoallergenic dog. I know getting a poodle of some sort would help alleviate this concern, but I have my eyes set on all non hypoallergenic dogs. ",2
"I got an ambulance ride out of my middle school because of an allergic reaction. Docs have no clue what it is. I got home, and now I'm here. Title should say it all, but gonna include a longer version, a sort of ts;dr thing.

Welp, in PE today I was all fucked up, among other things, my entire torso was covered in hives (fun amirite) So I go to the nurse, and shes like freaking out. She calls my parents, and my emergency contacts, none answer (greatparenting.jpg) and eventually, 911. I'm just sitting here casually, feeling fine other than a swelled throat. Paramedics show up, and take my vitals, im fine, but they take me on the stretcher down to the hospital anyway. I went to see an allergist, and they still have no clue. And this all happened about 5 or 6 hours ago.",2
"I'm allergic to nuts. What are the insides of Butterfingers and Reese's Cups like? I see the insides of these candies on television commercials and print advertisements and things like that, but I have no idea how the textures really feel. The only real guesses I can make are that Butterfingers look delicious, with insides looking as if they might be sort of like honeycomb, and that the peanut butter in Reese's Cups looks almost aerated or crumbly- very much unlike peanut butter you'd buy in a jar.

Am I close at all? If I'm not, how would you describe these treats to somebody who has never had them and will never have them?",2
"I wouldn’t wish this on any person I’m allergic to BOTH dogs and cats. Life is tough man. If I see the cutest pupper strolling through the park, I can’t just pet him. Despite my allergies I have the cutest cat cause I couldn’t resist taking her off the streets. I can’t even snuggle her let alone even think about petting her without washing my hands. Feels bad man, all my homies that are the same way, You are not alone. I hope one day there will be a magical cure to allergies and I can snuggle all the animals I want. Have a good day, I’m bored and locked out of work and saw a cat video.",2
"I got my first allergic reaction and now I look stupid So I sometimes get really bad breakouts, and I bought some benzoyl peroxide from the chemist which is meant to help. It did, my spots are gone, but in their place I have a whole face of itchy, sore, burning red rash which is apparently contact dermatitis/a mild allergic reaction to the spot treatment. I went to the pharmacy and they gave me calamine lotion, which is just as itchy but my face is all white and chalky, and if I wash it off all its good healing properties wash off with it.

I look really dumb and my face hurts, and I had to cancel plans tonight because I look like a leper.

How's everyone else doing today?",2
"I’m 30 years old and just learned I have asthma and multiple food allergies. Somehow I made it to 30 years old without knowing I had asthma. I’ve been coughing for over a month and no one could figure out why (multiple covid tests y’all...). My dad, who has terrible asthma, finally put it together and once they got me some asthma meds- cough is almost gone. 

Then today I was eating a banana. Coughed a little bit after. Dad asks why I’m coughing so I say I just ate a banana. He said why are you eating bananas if you’re allergic? I say I’m not allergic! He said “I cough after eating bananas and I’m allergic. Your sister coughs after eating bananas and she’s allergic. You’re allergic to bananas.” 

I start thinking back... I ask if coughing after I eat a lot of ice cream means I’m allergic to that too. Yup. 

It’s a miracle I’m still alive, y’all.",2
"Might be allergic to caffeine So yesterday, I drank a monster at a friend's house, and a few minutes later was covered in itchy hives. Didn't think much of it, as I drink monster, red bull etc several times a month, and woke up in the morning perfectly fine. But today, after having another monster after a long day of volunteer work, same thing happened again. I decided to get my mom to take me to the ER and they gave me an anti-histamine shot and some tablets, but didn't seem too worried.

I really hope I'm not allergic to monster energy or caffeine, because that was the only thing i ate/drank/had contact with on both days, but I'll find out tomorrow when I see the derma.",2
"Dog breed recommendations? I moved into my own place and it’s a little lonely. Found out I’m allergic to cats, so I couldn’t take mine with me. (She stayed with my folks, so no worries there.)

My apartment isn’t too big, about 400 sq ft or so. I’m home a lot right now and don’t foresee that changing anytime soon due to COVID.

It would be nice to take care of something. My apartment restricts Pit Bulls, German Shepards, Huskies/Malamutes, and Doberman Pinschers. 

I am what I’d consider maybe a more laid back/reserved type of personality.

All things considered, what dog breed would be good? I love big dogs but I’m open-minded. I want to adopt. 🙂",2
"I'm allergic to cold weather I want to start off by saying I live in Socal, away from the coast so I'm generally used to hot weather and anything under 65 degrees is pretty cold to me.

 I first noticed my reaction to the cold in middle school. One afternoon in P.E. class I remember shivering and feeling itchy , when I looked down at my hands they were breaking out in hives. 

Well fast forward throughout my life I began to realize that I would break out in hives when I shivered, or when I was just generally really cold. My hives appear on either my hands, forearms, knees, or feet. 

Sometimes it happens when my body experiences a sudden change in temperature such as being in a spa then stepping out, but this isn't as common. 

I think it's kind of weird, and my hands look all funky too (as if they were bit up by mosquitoes), but it is what it is. 

Are any of you guys allergic to anything out of the ordinary?",2
"The stray cat I’ve been feeding for the past 2 months brought me a dead lizard All of my roommates in the apartment are allergic to cats and I don’t want to isolate a cat in my bedroom so instead of getting a cat, I’ve been feeding 2 stray cats in the area. 

The bowls I have out front are on two opposite sides and each cat picked different sides so I know which is which. One came and ate his dinner while I was outside. I went back in and later came back outside and there was a dead lizard near the bowl of the same cat. 

I thought it was very sweet of him despite it being a dead lizard. He brought me a present which was cute

"My dog is a favourite of our vets My fiancé went to the vet today to get our dog her worming tablet, and when the girl behind the counter double checked what dog it was she said “oh yeah she’s one of my favourites!” And it just made my day, being a nervous dog mum I’m always second guessing how we’re doing as pet parents (dogs were never my first choice but I’m allergic to everything else)",2
"Dogs are better than people I never had a pet growing up. My parents told me it's because I have hayfever so I'm allergic to animal dander. Then when I moved out and in with my partner, he had a dog. Up until I spent quite some time with doggo I always thought 'theyre just animals, not really family' etc. I'm sitting here with doggo on my lap, cuddled into me and now I understand what it is to love a pet. They always want to play with you, they're funny little creatures and I've never had a human jump for joy and pee themselves with excitement to see me.

"Does your throat tingle when you're near spicy food? As if I needed context behind it, I have this strange thing about me where my throat starts tingling whenever I'm near spicy things, or I smell the spiciness from the food. Before you ask, no, its not an allergic reaction, i would have had a few trips to the hospital if so; but its the thought that my throat maybe anticipates the spicy. 
For example, I'd be at the grocery store, headed down the chips aisle, and I would grab a bag of Tapatio flavored Doritos (my favorite chips btw). The second I grab the bag, my throat will just start tingling heavily. 
So im asking because I'm genuinely curious about this, but does spiciness give you a tingle in your throat?",1
"So long wasps, im going to miss you. Ok, I just got stung by several of these buggers today.   Seriously those things hurt, anyway I had to dispatch several of them to avoid anymore stings and bites.  For the most part I'll live aside from a few welts and discomfort for a couple of hours.  I decided to call it quits for cleaning the yard and headed inside to relax from my encounter and to make sure I'm not going to develop an allergic reaction (luckily I'm fine).  I started really thinking about these guys and their role in the environment and yes they do pollinate and they also are predatory meaning they keep other insects in control.  Upon researching more, there are several studies indicating that these guys just like thier honey bee cousins are in great decline as well.  Anyone else concerned that we are seemingly facing a mass extinction?  (which is obviously not good.)",1
"Anyone ever develop a rash from taking antibiotics? Nothing serious, already been to the doc about it. Just finished up 7 days of a Bactrim for an infected bug bite I had, and yesterday I notice my entire body was covered in red spots, almost like chicken pox. Scared the heck out of me. Got to the doctor and he almost laughed when he said, ""No more Bactrim for you.""

Had an allergic reaction to it so now I'm on 6 days of steroids and Benadryl at night. 

Still a little freaky and the rash has gotten a bit worse today but he told me it wouldn't go away over night. 

Trying to do my best to relax today and keep my mind off it. Play some video games or something. Thankfully it's not too itchy, and no other symptoms that I can tell. My face maybe feels a little flushed, almost like a light sunburn, but that's it. 

Again, nothing serious, it should fade in a few days. Guess I'm hoping for some other positive stories of ""yep, got a weird rash but it went away"".",2
"What food makes you guys do a happy dance? For me personally, it's a Beyond Burger with no bun and just onion. It makes me totally forget that I have food restrictions and just lets me bliss out on the wonderful flavors.

When I discovered that I was allergic to red meat, allergic to a specific protein in milk, intolerant of soy, and don't do well with heavy carbs, I was pretty sure it was going to be an uphill battle. And it kind of was at first, having to readjust to a vegan-leaning pescatarian diet, but finding alternatives like Beyond Burgers and replacing meat in dishes with fish or shrimp has made me sometimes forget that meat is even an option.

So, what are your guys's happy-dance foods?",2

Like Mango , Pineapple etc . But when it came to fruits with a lot of seeds especially ones with small seeds I would freak out . I would ask people to keep them away from me as if I was allergic, which I am not. For some apparent reason  I would just fell weird and disgusted at times if I was asked to touch these fruits when cut , especially when I could see or touch the seeds . Like imagine a squishy tomato and its seeds . Nope! Or jackfruit seeds , oh hell nah . So ya in conclusion it is weird but I am not an fan of seeds .",2

"For the first time ever, I got to touch a cat! When I was really young, I went to a friends house who had a cat, I'm not sure why,but I was scared of it. Not even 20 minutes after arriving I found out I was allergic to cat hair. My mother picked me up immediately and got me some allergy medicine. So then I've stayed away from them.

But today, I go outside and there's a cat on my roof, I was scared because I wasn't sure if it could get down, I ended up kinda showing it around the house to where my shed is, it jumped off the roof to the roof of the shed, then jumped down to a garbage can, then to the ground. It started meowing and was brushing up against my legs, I was in awe. It was so soft I had to pet it. Now I want a cat haha. Going through the allergies was 500% worth and I would do it again! I hope that cat found its way home

5. What are you allergic to?",2

"Hardest I’ve ever laughed So around November, my friend and I were doing a crossword puzzle over Thanksgiving. In one square, he wrote the word “communism.” For some reason, I laughed really hard. Like, *really* hard. I was turning red, I couldn’t even breathe, talk or get any sound out. It was like a silent wheeze.  You would’ve thought I was having an allergic reaction if you looked at me.

He also wrote the words “bubble bitch” and “massacre” on the paper, which also made me laugh. For some reason.

What’s the hardest time you’ve ever laughed?",2

"There is a cat in my neighborhood that comes around when I have parties. His name is spot and he’s a delightfully chubby tabby. I’ve only seen him a hand full of times in the years I’ve lived here. The first time he came close to me was a few weeks ago when I was throwing an Oktoberfest party for my friends. He showed up and just walked on inside. He hung out until the party dissipated. 

This last Wednesday I had a few buddies from out of town at my place and he just showed up again looking for pets. Unfortunately my buddy is allergic so Spot (weird name for a cat) had to go outside. Watching my buddy lift him up at arms length was pretty funny. Unfortunately I think we made him mad because he pooped on my porch.",2

I have lactaid""- thanks I'm still allergic to lactaid- ""well here, have some money and go get something.""

Obviously I am not satisfied with the conversation we had, I want to share our experience with someone. 

Fun fact, I actually ended up in the hospital. Got stung by a bee and had an allergic reaction. It was pretty scary and unexpected, since I've never been allergic to bees nor been in the ambulance before. 

Feel free to ask anything if you want. I just wanna share my/our experience.",2
"I discovered my love for cats. I might be a little early for celebrating this, but just yesterday my boyfriend and I adopted a cat from a friend of ours that has a literal zoo in their one bedroom apartment. He’s all white except for his tail, but right now he’s an unnatural shade of pink. We call him Bean. This is my first cat, as I have been allergic to cats my whole life. But this one? Almost no allergies.

I know some people probably feel this all the time with their furry friend, but as someone who’s never really pet a fuzzy animal before it was breathtaking. This morning, Bean hopped onto the bed and laid right down next to me and started purring very loudly. It was so warm and he was so soft. Then he rubbed his face on my cheek. I almost cried it was so amazing! I’ve never had an animal do that to me before.

Right now, he’s in my lap enjoying the warm coffee cup in my hand, purring away. I hope this literally lasts forever!! ",2

"TIL that my mom has kept up the same lie for nearly 20 years TLDR; TIL that my mom has kept a secret from me and my brother for almost 20 years. 

Ever since I was little my mom made me and my brother believe that she was allergic to feathers. It started off where she would sneeze when my younger brother held them to her nose. 

She would pretend to sneeze just to make us smile but over the years my brother never caught on. He STILL believes she’s allergic because just the other day he took some feathers and brought them to her nose. She sneezed like she’s always done but this caused her to remember that it’s been a lie for this long. 

I was accidentally informed about this while my brother was not present. She’s completely under the impression that she can’t tell him and will keep this up until he has kids of his own.",2

Also, where I live, flowers and trees are blooming already. I’m allergic to almost everything (dogs, cats, pet dander, dust mites, grass, pollen, mould, hazelnuts, peanuts, fresh apples etc.).

My allergies are so bad I feel like I have the flu. My nose runs like crazy, my voice sounds scratchy, I have sneezing fits every day and if I go a few minutes without blowing my nose the mucus just starts dripping on the floor. It's getting so bad that I can't go out with friends anymore and just feel like laying in bed.

So my oldest brother recently joined the army around 6 months ago and I wanted to share a freaky story. My brother has around 19 allergies which ranges from what he eats to different types of dyes. When he joined the army, the people there found out that he had around 6 more allergies which we didn't know about. One of then has something to do about his reaction towards sudden changes in temperatures. We live in Texas and he moved to Oklahoma during July.

"They played a mean joke Precursor: I’m allergic to cats, but I do like them

I had to be picked up by my brother and dad from something and they said they needed to pick up cat litter from the store. Their excuse was that my ex step mom had gotten a spontaneous cat, which isn’t too hard to believe because she did randomly get a dog one day. 

I was actually secretly excited, a little peeved that she didn’t consider that I was allergic, but they said it was a sphinx cat, so it was better I guess.

We got the kitty litter and went home, they said the cat was just wandering around, and that we had to find it. 

They let me search the house for like ten minutes before making fun of me for thinking we got a cat. 

I was excited! I like cats! I was a little sad, but also relieved that ex step mom didn’t get another animal to feed, and to shit in the house, because she let the dogs piss in the kitchen -_-",2

- I find dogs frightening due to an incident that I would prefer not to speak about 
- I keep a strict vegan diet so opening up a can of sulphurous pink meat mush for a carnivorous animal would not help me achieve my therapeutic goals
- I do not find fish or turtles therapeutic 
- nor birds, except flightless birds that cannot be legally kept in my district 
- I already feed squirrels in the park so I know their ways
- I have several oak trees in my yard so I would not need to buy food (acorns)

So yesterday, I tried peanut butter cookies, PBJ sandwich, and even Nutella (I thought maybe if I didn't react to peanuts, I wouldn't react to hazelnuts either) and surprisingly I didn't react at all to any of them which I'm super happy about since I used to get unbearable itching and swelling whenever I ate any of these things and it took 19 years to finally overcome these allergies lol.

The vaccine didn't hurt at all! The needle and the actual injection were both painless, and it took, like, half a second. It is the least painful shot I've ever had. The liquid is thin (meaning that not only does the injection hurt less, but the needle is smaller in circumference) and the dose isn't super large.

Some background info-
In 2010 I started spitting out food because I was unable to swallow it. I went in for testing to see what was wrong and I was diagnosed with (mild) EoE. It took another 2 or so years to find out what I was allergic to peanuts. In that time period the doctors took me off dairy, eggs, milk, and oats but nothing helped. Eventually they taped a bunch food samples on my back and peanuts caused irritation and I was taken off them. 10 years later I had zero problems even when I accidentally ate a burger fries in peanut oil. The doctor said I was peanut intolerant, but then they pricked me and now I’m not allergic anymore.",2

"Reusing N95 masks Just like most hospitals, my hospital has also been asking us to reuse masks. They request us to drop it in a bin so they can send it through decon process and then we get the masks back. They want us to reuse them up to 7 times.

I have (self diagnosed) allergic and vasomotor rhinitis. I've tried on two of these decon'ed masks over the last week and each time I had to lift my mask (often multiple times while with a patient) to blow my mask. My first day I thought it was b/c I'd forgotten to take my antihistamine, but then the same thing happened yesterday (despite taking my antihistamine), I had to discard my mask in 1h of putting it on.

I guess I want to reach out our meddit folks and see how I should (or if I should) address this with leadership within my department without seeming like a pansy who is just avoiding to reuse masks (which I'm also against but willing to do just b/c everyone else is doing so as well).",2

When I was in college in the 90s, I had one roommate in our house who was allergic to nuts, so I had to put out a note for her to not eat the cookies if I put nuts in them, but I don't recall anyone else having any problems.

Now it seems you can't bring any food with nuts to any school function.

I have recently been having airway issues and it’s actually very easy to link that to a mold issue in my house.  I took it a step farther to see if there’s any possible link or links to my mental health problems that began developing years ago.  And yes, there are high possibilities that mold contributed to my mental health difficulties.  

I got tested for allergies when I was a teenager and they found I was allergic to dust mites, cats and dogs and mold but they weren’t certain about the mold test for a reason I can’t remember.  I got a bunch of shots to “immunize” my body for dust mites, cats and dogs, but not mold....

Going to see a psychiatrist! My aunt gave my family money for both my mom and I's counseling. I'm going to see my regular therapist hopefully next time text week. I'm also going to see a psychiatrist to see if they can figure out what all this psychosis shit is. I've heard they use different medications for pyschosis but I really don't know if I want to try that again because I am allergic to most medications except the birth control I'm on right now. When I say allergic like I have severe muscle spasms where I throw my arms and legs so I can't walk. My therapist has recommended I get a service dog or ESA. So I'm hoping the psychiatrist agrees so maybe my parents will see I need one and work towards getting one.,2
"I booked a flight and air BnB for my Suicide. I have been working on a book for months now. My life story and stories of my alters. I’m getting it published in November, look for it, “Taboo Illusions”. After my birthday in November I plan to fly to Mt. Rainer and stay in this little cottage. I want to hike for a couple days, cool good meals, drink champagne, then on my last night die. I want to cook my favorite meal, drink champagne, eat chocolate covered strawberries( which I’m highly allergic too) and sit in the jacuzzi tub in my cottage I rented. I plan on using my 10 blade scalpels, slitting my wrist, taking a bunch of ambien, drinking champagne, and eat chocolate covered strawberries. I’ll be gone, but a piece of me will stay.",1
How do you manage your mental illness to the point of (almost) being happy? When I’m sober I feel depressed and out of control of my emotions. Anxiety ridden and not stable. when I use and drink I just feel anger and self hatred. I’ve tried medicines but ended up having allergic reactions. Does counseling actually work? I’ve been when my father died but I remembered absolutely hating it. Please help. How do you guys handle mental illness???,2
"Anxiety, foods, allergies. So, my partner has just received a posting to China in 2020. The only problem is, we both suffer from nut allergies. I also have extreme phobias about having an allergic reaction. I've heard that China uses a lot of nuts. Now I'm freaking out. Can't sleep, can't function. I don't know what to do.",2
What should I do? I just moved into a new apartment and have been considering getting a cat for quite a while to help with my severe depression and anxiety. I didn't get one at my last apartment because one of my roommates was allergic. One of my new roommates has 2 small dogs as emotional support animals and says they don't get along with other animals very well so I can't get a cat. She lives in the basement and I live in the top floor. Should I tell her I'm getting one anyway and she should train her dogs better? Would it be too unfair to just keep the cat in my room all the time? I feel like a pet would really help me come with things in my day to day life and provide so much needed physical contact with another living thing (I haven't had a hug in months and feel touch starved). I'm not sure what to do about this situation and would really appreciate some advice. Tyia!,2
"Does anyone have advice for health anxiety? I suffer from pretty bad health anxiety. It is off an on in severity, but it is consistently there. 
Every time I eat something, I keep checking my arms for rashes to make sure I'm not having an allergic reaction. I'm very aware of my throat because I'm paranoid about having it close up. I am also terrified of passing out and hate being anywhere alone in case I pass out. 
I come up with something worrisome enough every day that I think I should go to the doctor. I have to tell myself to wait it out, and it is terrifying. My doctors will find small things here and there, but that is it.  

My anxiety came on fairly suddenly a few years ago and it has been quite a struggle since then. I think it has always been health related. My first panic attack was because I thought I was going to throw up, and I often have panic attacks over having to go somewhere or being left home alone when I am not feeling well, which ends up being most days. ",2
"How do you manage your anxiety without medication? Hello all! As far back as I can remember, I have had spells of having a hard time breathing. Recently I have been under a lot of stress with relationships and professionally and it has gotten significantly worse. I initially thought I was allergic to something I was eating, but I decided to do some investigating and I'm pretty sure I have general anxiety disorder. 

My dilemma is this: I had my thyroid removed about 10 years ago and have been on medication my entire life. I don't want to take any more meds than what I have to. I have heard the side effects of anxiety medicine and I already feel that without being on the medicine, I know my health will be negatively affected if I take them. 

What are some self-help remedies that can relieve the anxiety attacks that I seem to be continuously having? 

TL;DR I recently self-diagnosed anxiety and I don't want to take medication. Any non-medicinal remedies that you can suggest?",2

"My Grandmother, who is suffering from Alzheimer's, got my sexual orientation confused today. Just felt like this was worth sharing.  Today, my family visited my grandma at the care home.  Her brother showed up too, so there was more than the usual conversation during such a visit.  She is suffering from Alzheimer's and can barely remember who I am half the time, but chimed in every once in a while in response to what my father and great uncle were discussing.  The subject of my relationship came up in the conversation and my father joked about how I might be getting married soon.  Upon hearing this, my grandma said in an excited, completely-serious voice, ""Oh! What's his name?""  My reply was speechlessness as everyone else in the room, including my clueless grandmother, burst into laughter.  I had no other choice but to laugh with them in slight embarrassment, as my great-uncle said that we would all just forget about that one.",2

"Goong to visit my wife’s grandma who was diagnosed with early stages Alzheimers We are traveling today, grandma has called my wife 3-5 the past couple days asking when we are coming. Today she called saying she is sick and can not go to the beach today.(?) This is my first experience with this illness and I am also not the best at helping my wife handle something like this. She is taking very hard since she is very close to her. What is something i can or should be expecting on this visit or how i can help her?",2
"Is it bad that it takes me a few seconds to remember my own name when I wake up? It has always been like this, it’s not something that just happened recently. I have a naturally bad memory and I estimate my IQ to be somewhere in the negatives. But I’ve only just now been told by my friend that it’s not normal to forget your own name upon waking. Also I’m 24 so what are the chances of me having Alzheimer’s?",2
"Second night and still need someone to talk to. So it's my second night that I'll be sleeping here in the hospital with my mom and grandpa. I'm kinda stressed because my grandpa can drink his meds and he is acting like a kid now (and there's nothing wrong with him acting that way) I guess it's normal when someone has Alzheimer's disease. I just hope that I'll have more strength as we stay here in the hospital.

Let's talk about random things :))",2
"Does anyone have suggestions on how to pass time on a long car trip with my dad? My (19M) dad (54M) just got a call today that his Dad is dying from Alzheimer’s disease. He’s probably gonna make the car trip tomorrow to go visit him one last time, but the trip is about 10 hours. It looks like either me or my mom is going to go with him to spend time with him, as 10 hours is a long time to be alone with your thoughts in a time like this. I imagine it’ll be pretty hard to maintain idle conversation for that long all the time, so does anyone have any suggestions for good car activities, like a podcast or something akin to that that we can laugh or talk about? I just want to distract him and take his mind off things, so any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.",2
"Is it common to have no memory whatsoever of reading a Wikipedia article, paragraph from a book, etc. even when you read it a week or two ago? I’m sitting here, having just picked back up an ebook I’ve been reading slowly for the last few weeks. I’m reading a few pages, it’s interesting and nothing is ringing a bell, then I get to a line that I remember, and I realize that I already read this section and the ebook didn’t sync between my devices.

This happens to me all the time. I’ve realized a while ago that I can re-read the same Wikipedia articles a few times a year and it still feels fresh each time.

Now I’m making myself paranoid that I’ve got early onset Alzheimer’s.

I was just wondering whether this is relatable to the majority of people, or if my memory just sucks.",1
"Sometimes you gotta enjoy the small things. Currently sitting at my grandparents watching TV with them. Not many members of my family stop by and visit, but I like to try to see them more than half the days in the week. 

It's nice to sit on the couch and just pet their cat, enjoy the silence, (my grandfather muted the TV and forgot) and listen to my grandmother while she makes tea in the kitchen.

My grandfather has Alzheimer's and he has gone from this great strong man who spoke six languages and worked every day to essentially having the mind of a six year old. It's tough to see and even harder on my grandmother, but he still talks and seems happy every day, laughing, sitting outside and watching birds or the ducks on the pond. 

It's sobering to know that one day they will be gone, and I won't have these moments again, so I will enjoy them while I can.",2
My grandma will turn “20” on Leap Day this year. Just had that epiphany. My grandma has recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s so she’s been on my mind a lot lately. She turned 16 the same year as my cousin and 18 a month before me. So we both had special birthday parties with her those years. This year she will be 20 in 2020. I’ll have a newborn with me but now I’m thinking about doing something special for her now. Even if it’s just baking a special cake.,2
"My elderly neighbour doesn't recognize me anymore.. Every time I see her, I try to be friendly and say hi, but everytime I do, shegives me a blank stare, as if trying to remember who I am or as if she'd never seen me before. She is one wonderful lady, and I adored hearing her stories (she was a kid during the Fascist regime and would sometimes speak about her experiences during and after the war), but now I do wonder if she has dementia or Alzheimer's. I will see her everyday walking the same path to the supermarket yet she never seems to buy anything. When I do see her, I'll often stop and watch her walk, but I'm too sad (or perhaps, surprised) to say anything other than ""good morning""",2

"I miss my grandma. Hello all, I was washing some dishes and started to remember some memories from the past. My grandma came up into my head. She passed away a few years ago from a heart attack, with Alzheimer's. 

I was just remembering this one time when I had bought a ocarina and I was determined to learn it. My family, especially my cousin, thought it sounded horrible. One afternoon, only me and my grandma was in the house. She came over and leaned against the doorway as I played it. She was laughing at me. It was a lovely moment still, because she was already losing herself. I hadn't heard her laugh in quite awhile.

Tell me about your happy memories! Maybe of people that have passed, or someone that's still in your life? ",2
"Has anyone else ever been attacked by a animal ? Today I was at my great grandpas house and he has Alzheimer's disease. My uncle who watched him has a few fish in a tank from South Africa 🇿🇦. 

When ever I go there, I put my finger above the water and move it around and they follow it. Today I asked my uncle ""When's the last time they've been fed"" and he said ""yesterday"" it then jumped up and got his mouth half way around my little finger. 

I pulled my finger out immediately, and had no injuries. I was just scared shitless. ",2
"I think I realized tonight I like my job. I just started a couple weeks ago as a cna in a nursing home.  I wasn't sure I liked it, super busy always dealing with some kinda bodily fluid. Well, tonight I think I realized I actually really enjoy it. I like having conversations with the residents, and hearing what they have to say, even if some of it doesn't make sense (dementia or Alzheimer's residents) they just light up when they talk about certain things. 

I got told today by one resident to make sure I always keep smiling. I didn't realize I smiled at them much, because honestly I have depression and I feel like I'm always kinda meh. Also Ive been putting the same lady to bed for a while and caring for her, she's like ""you're a really good nurse."" (Even though I'm a cna lol) it made me happy. I'm glad I can kinda brighten or bring a happy mood to a residents day.

"Being 100 years old has gotta be one of the most badass things ever. Especially if you're healthy and active. I read about a 103 year old who came to New York from Puerto Rico in the 30s, retired in the 70s, and still sneaks away from his family in New Jersey to visit friends in Brooklyn. He's never had cancer, Alzheimer's, diabeetus, or any other common ailments. Imagine being nine decades old and some dude is still ten years your elder.",2
"So I had a dream about my dead dog this morning This morning that I had a dream my dog was still alive(Dead since 2007 due to Canine Alzheimers). All is good until my mind started to ponder ""My dog was born around 1992...in 2002 he was ten...in 2012 makes him twenty...there's no way I have a twenty-ish year old dog, I'm dreaming.""

I got to lucid dream for a whopping four seconds before waking up. It's funny because I'm typically terrible at math let alone mental arithmetic. OF COURSE it had to be spoiled to a dream like that.

So uhh, how often you dream about your dead pets?",2

I forget things all the time like I wake up every morning and forgot I use glasses until I try to read something or pay attention to certain details. I usually lost my keys or my ID and my dad just says ""Pay attention kid !

My voice was lower, can’t be pushed too much. I’m still finding my voice range. Don’t know how to find it accurately though.

I finally stood up to my bully He has been bullying me for almost 5 years. I got tired of it. Yesterday he came up to me and tried to beat me up so i hit him and he started to cry. But then his left arm turned into a chainsaw and his right arm in to a machine gun. I thought he would kill me but then a sword came from the sky. This sword was really cool and had lots of cool things because it was a cool laser sword. I then defeated him in an epic battle with lots of explosions. After defeating him the military came and awarded me 15 medals. My crush said she loved me. The president later became my best friends and i got to be the first person on mars.

"My Grandpa's dying. My dad went to visit him in the hospital, intending to only stay for the weekend, but he's still there after nearly a week.

My Grandpa's had Alzheimer's that's been getting worse, and his overall health is declining. From what I've heard, he passed out at dinner, and was taken to the hospital.

It will kill you. 

Not getting enough sleep demolishes your immune system, more that doubling your risk of cancer.

Not getting enough sleep is a big factor in whether or not you will develop Alzheimer’s disease.

It will disrupt sugar levels to the point of being classified as pre-diabetic.

It will chase cardiovascular disease, strokes, and cognitive heart failure.

It also contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal behavior.

I can't cope with this, because school is stressing me out, and my friends have all turned against me. I'm going to therapy once a week, but there is no escape from all this stress.

They don’t like Pantone on my uncle or aunts side and it bothers me how loved they are when in reality they are hateful, what should I do",2
"New troubling condition Recently, I've found myself just speaking random words out loud, just out of the blue. They're not thoughts in my mind or connected to anything that's going on (the most recent one was ""I didn't go to the hospital that day""). This is something I've been experiencing for about three weeks now and it has me pretty worried. Is there a name for this issue/any knowledge of what might be happening?

I'll also add that while there's a history of Alzheimer's Disease in my family, I'm only 35. I also have mild autism, but never had this particular problem until quite recently.",2
"My father has always been brilliant, but lately is becoming less so My father (63 years old) has always been a genius.  Over the last year though, he seems to becoming more...dumb.  more and more often he has been asking me how to do things that he has known how to do for years (I.e. forgetting how to change the input on the TV, how to check his voicemail, thinking that Netflix is a channel through the cable, and asking what channel number is Netflix, etc). He is(and always has been) extremely stubborn, and whenever we try talking to him about it, says that nothing is wrong, and makes up excuses why he ""never learned how to do these things"" and won't go to a psychologist to address it.  My specialty is autism, beyond that, my knowledge is limited at best.  Could this be signs of Alzheimer's?",2
"I really want this year to end. 2018 has been the hardest, longest and most emotionally taxing year of my life. My girlfriend's grandfather passed away. My girlfriend then broke up with me. The week later my great grandfather passed away. Three weeks after that my 15 year old dog passed away. A week later my great aunt passes away and now my great uncle is in the final stages of Alzheimers.

I do find it interesting however, that the event out of all of these which hurts me the most and makes me the saddest is my girlfriend breaking up with me. 

Either way, I don't know how much more I can handle. It seems like no matter what I do, bad things keep happening. What's the point of anything anymore?",2
"Memory loss  **Memory loss** that disrupts daily life may be a symptom of Alzheimer's or other dementia. Alzheimer's is a brain disease that causes a slow decline in memory, thinking and reasoning skills. Many people worry about becoming forgetful. They think forgetfulness is the first sign of Alzheimer's disease. But not all people with memory problems have Alzheimer's. ... Other causes for memory problems can include aging, medical conditions, emotional problems, mild cognitive impairment, or another type of dementia. When memory loss becomes so pervasive and severe that it disrupts your work, hobbies, social activities, and family relationships, you may be experiencing the warning signs of Alzheimer's disease, or another disorder that causes dementia, or a condition that mimics dementia.

"Failing memory at early age Good evening friends, I am just under 30 years old and have been having trouble with my memory for years and years. It's so bad that it affects my daily life, work life, etc. I know in today's age of technology, it's easy to be distracted, but I can't even remember a thought or a to-do long enough to get out my notepad or phone to write it down! My wife always jokes that I have Alzheimers at 30 years old already but she's not far off. I struggle to remember things walking out of a work meeting even. The meeting happened yesterday? I can forget about knowing what the subject was.

Does anyone have any real proven exercises for improving memory or helpful tactics to help me cope with this?

Thanks!",2
"Mental health issue I'm a 27 year old caucasian male, 150lb, 5'8, who has been suffering for at least 2 years. I have gone to the doctors a few times, but they've basically dismissed my complaints after blood tests for diabetes and thyroidism presumably came back negative.

It'll be great.,2
"I’m 30 years old and just learned I have asthma and multiple food allergies. Somehow I made it to 30 years old without knowing I had asthma. I’ve been coughing for over a month and no one could figure out why (multiple covid tests y’all...). My dad, who has terrible asthma, finally put it together and once they got me some asthma meds- cough is almost gone. 

Then today I was eating a banana. Coughed a little bit after. Dad asks why I’m coughing so I say I just ate a banana. He said why are you eating bananas if you’re allergic? I say I’m not allergic! He said “I cough after eating bananas and I’m allergic. Your sister coughs after eating bananas and she’s allergic. You’re allergic to bananas.” 

I start thinking back... I ask if coughing after I eat a lot of ice cream means I’m allergic to that too. Yup. 

It’s a miracle I’m still alive, y’all.",2

"Just wanted to complain a little Okay, so last year, I found out that I have some sort of seasonal asthma that has caused my chest and upper back to tighten up; makes it hard to breathe through heavy activity. But that's not what I needed to complain about. The problem is whenever I'm trying to go to sleep, but my back feels like wood, I have to roll and flop around until I land in a pretzel-twist, semi-circle, just-fell-out-of-a-ten-story-building contortion that finally stretches out my back at the expense of all my other muscles. It's nuts. And then I wake up in the morning still tired and still tight.

I just needed to whine about that for a second. Does anyone else have this back problem or something like it?",2

What should I alternatively use, aside from a shower, which I'll obviously do regardless. Would body butter work, or should I just ditch it completely and not use anything?",2
"Struggling with everything a bit and don't want to bother everyone by complaining. So I had asthma as a kid, this summer it came back. The doctors think it's a combination of covid and all the smoke from the wildfires in Colorado where I live. I am just exhausted all the time. I can't exercise much because I can't breathe.

 Exercising is one of my main ways of fighting depression which is especially important due to the pandemic and winter existing right now. I feel so bad because I cant exercise with my dog as much as I used to and as much as he wants.

My husband and family have been very supportive, but there's nothing they can do. The fact is that my lungs will get better with time or they won't. No one can know. They just want to do something. Thanks for reading. I just really wanted to talk to someone that wouldn't try and fix it.",2
"I woke up this morning after a bad asthma attack, and felt my lungs full of air. What's something else incredibly satisfying to wake up to? Last night I was heading off to bed, and when I knelt to scoop my cat up for cuddle time, I felt the air rush out of my body.  I laid out on the floor for a few minutes before pulling myself up and out to the car, and to urgent care.  I got a shot of steroids, a breathing treatment, and got to bed about 2 hrs later.  

When I woke up,  I felt so wonderful.  None of that early morning wheeze, just pure air mixed with the normal amount of ""my cat sleeps on my face"" fur.   

It was like when you have the first bite of a new desert and you're surprised with how perfect it is, or when your ears pop when you didn't realize you needed it.",2
"After about 10 years my asthma has returned I used to have asthma up until I was about 11-12 when I ""grew out of it"". It got so bad that I was admitted into the hospital for a couple days multiple times and put on every asthma treatment there was.

For the past 2 weeks I've been having classic asthma symptoms. Not nearly as bad as before. Decided to stop messing around and get medicine for it today. I just got back from the pharmacist to grab an inhaler and some cough medicine.

Opening the box to the inhaler was pretty upsetting. I thought I was done with this. Using the inhaler and having it work in 2 minutes really didn't help.",2

Good for them. 

Everyday though, there are people, mainly older people who come in every day to buy fucking steak. I’ve already heard from people whose freezers are full. Who have plenty of stuff at home. For them: it’s a convenience thing. For me, I have asthma. 

Just please, stay home. Our forefathers and mothers made monumental sacrifices to get us to where we are today. All most people have to do right now is stay home for a few weeks and binge Netflix",2

"What does it feel like to breathe? Hello all! I’m new here so if my question is out of place then I apologize.

I’ve had asthma my entire life and obviously that makes it difficult to breathe to the point that I need to lay a certain way to sleep. I saw a post recently of someone with anemia who finally feels what it’s like to breathe and now I’m wondering what that feels like.

Maybe I’m just over-thinking things and I can actually breathe normally or close to it and I actually don’t know, but I’m still curious nonetheless. Also: what does it feel like to run out of breath when you run or lift heavy or do active things in general? Is it super painful for everyone?",2
"I can finally run without feeling like I’m going to die!!! I’m almost 28 years old and my entire life I’ve never been able to run for more than a few minutes at a time without my heart and chest feeling like they were going to explode.

I’m so excited to start exercising more now!",2
"I can finally breathe through my nose!!! I have never really been able to breathe through my nose because it is always super congested and feels like I can’t get any air in (anyone else this way?) I’ve never been to a doctor about it, which I probably should. I finally tried nasal strips and the second I put it on, I could ACTUALLY breathe. I truly can’t believe it. This is the first time in my life. Wow. Had to share!!

EDIT: Also have pretty bad allergies and my doctor says I have asthma lol",2
"I always thought jogging was the worst. My throat would close up, I'd get a deep chest pain and would have a dry cough and headache for hours afterward. But everybody hates exercise, right? So I  assumed I was just weak and out of shape. Never could run more than a few minutes. 

A couple years ago, a doctor suggested I get an inhaler. I didn't really know how to use one. When I played around with it a little and it didn't change my jogging experience, I wasn't surprised. Figured I'd just been looking for an excuse not to exercise.

Now COVID-19 hits. I'm looking up info on the virus and see it affects people with asthma especially hard. Webpage includes instructions for using an inhaler. I'm sitting on the couch bored. Why not watch a twenty second video on how to use a tool to help me breathe?

Tried it today. Ran 17.5 minutes. I can't believe it took me this long to understand that moving my body doesn't have to hurt me.",2

"I really wish I could stay home, but it isn’t up to me. I work in a lab that is working on developing COVID test kits, but I am not directly involved in it. I am not doing the experiments, someone else is. I do the ordering of supplies, which I could easily do from home. Other than instrument maintenance (which I could come in to do if needed), I could and should be able to stay home. Plus, I’m in my mid-fifties with asthma, so I am higher risk. 

But even knowing this, the boss says we are ALL essential. So I really hate people posting on Facebook telling us to stay home! Dammit, I would if I could! It’s not up to me, and if I were to tell the boss I want to stay home, I might get fired. So stop making me feel bad!",2
"Are there any recovering nasal spray addicts out there? I relapsed and I’m really struggling. I used to be so dependent on nasal sprays that I’d turn blue without them. My asthma made it almost impossible for me to stop. Eventually I got surgery to fix my deviated septum and was able to stop. I have a really bad cold and my asthma is flaring up and a couple of days ago I couldn’t even lie down to sleep my breathing was so heavy, I was looking for Mucinex when I came across an old, expired nasal spray in my medicine cabinet. My husband probably got it for himself and never got around to using it because it was sealed. I opened it, had my first spray in years and cleared up like magic. Now I’m sitting on my couch, wheezing and congested and I can’t think of anything but magically clearing my airway with the spray.",2
"Girlfriend in hospital overnight, can’t sleep Hey all, just looking for some small talk because I’m next to my girlfriend in the hospital as she sleeps. Don’t plan on getting very much sleep. Her mom is in the room too but she’s asleep as well so maybe I’ll get some rest once she is awake. Just need some sort of stimuli, ask me any questions, tell me some interesting facts, give me any of your unpopular or radical opinions. 

Edit: suppose I should have said this in the first place. My girlfriend has chronic asthma + eczema and since she has both they perpetuate each other and she won’t be able to outgrow them. She caught a cold recently and had an asthma attack while having a cold so it did serious damage to her lungs. Her breathing stabilized but she still needs assistance, the biggest battle is getting her heart rate stabilized currently. She’s finally sleeping though which is good. ",2

What’s your favorite way to pass time when sick?",2
"Anyone else knocked out by allergy right now? Gotta love autumn... hay fever, asthma, hives and pink eyes. The nicer non-sedative drugs don't work and the one that somewhat works for me leaves me sleepy or sleeping all day. Anyone else also having their day ruined by allergies?",2
"I need ""physical hugs"" Everyone is kind here and I come here to relieve my sadness. You guys are amazing. You give me ""virtual hugs"".

But it's about reality now. I've been suffered from asthma and kind of depressed. Bad memories from old times come back to my mind at once and I feel heavy.

I believe that something to ease this is hugs, but physically. But there aren't habits for hugging each other in my country and of course, there are no kind people to let me hug as strangers.

You may think that ""You should do that to your family."" but as said previously we have never hugged and it is normal.

It must be pretty difficult question for you but what should I do?",2

Within a month I was doing a cigarette a day from a cigarette a week. Before long, it became at least 2-3 cigarettes a day, generally more, with times going up to a pack a night. Oh, and I have chronic asthma. So I just decided to give up habitual smoking, saving it more for the occasional crazy night or celebration. I hope I can do it.",2

"Do you hate/scare the smell of a certain place? I come to hate the smell of hospital ever since i was a kid. For a person who was diagnosed with both asthma and pneumonia, i have to be in the ER a lot as well as hospital trip for treatment. I feel completely terrifying of the crying babies, the smell of drugs and diseases everywhere. I even have a distinctive smell that i sense every time i come even remotely close to a hospital

"I can't breaaathe )': I've been sick since mid-November >: Well, I'm much better now than I was before, but I sure am sick of the wheezing and coughing (Pokemon anyone?) My doctor says that the cold/flu I dealt with in November and beginning of December may have aggravated asthma that I wasn't aware I had. Can't get a rest with all the whistling and creaking noises coming from my chest area ):

How about you guys? Any of you sick with a flu? How are you holding up? Any advice to ease these asthma symptoms a bit?

"Is anyone else a mouth breather? I am having some fuckin allergies or some shit because I can not breathe clearly through my nose holes. I mean it's always been like this but for the past few days its been shitty af.

Also can anyone else not sleep without breathing through their nose? I am one of those people. I cringe  at the thought of how many bugs must have crawled and died while visiting a nice dank cave that is my mouth ;-;

Edit: I just realized that my asthma might have a relation to this. Sometimes when I become conscious of my breathing I will try to take a deep breathe using my nose but I just feel like I didn't breathe any air in and in a sense of panic I take a deep breathe of air though my mouth. IDK I am weird.",2
"Any needle-phobics give plasma? Hi all. Times are a little tough right now for our family and my wife had the thought of giving plasma. Catch is, I’m quite afraid of needles.

"How common are panic attacks? How many people get them? I had no idea what panic attacks were until a few days ago when one of my friend's friends said he was having one after I scared him. He went to the bathroom so I his under the couch and grabbed his foot when he sat back down. He started breathing heavy and shit... said something about a panic attack. I thought he meant an asthma attack, so I offered my inhaler. I was corrected. So he's 'all better' but he hates me now. I mean, I didn't know he had whiny bitch syndrome...anyway, I googled it and apparently panic attacks are a real thing that people have. I understand what they are. So how many people get them, and what triggers them?",2

Any advice for getting back into shape. I’ve gotten fat now and I’d prefer no one see my pot belly outside of my family so I rather not run up and down the street. The tread mill we have is outside so it defeats the purpose of a treadmill. 

I would prefer exercises without much equipment as I don’t have room for it. Also anything outside is not an option because the pollen has increased significantly my asthma and allergies can’t take it 😞

"Question for CPAP and asthma Hey all,

So this is a topic I see that pops up quite frequently and I have never had a direct answer one way or another. Here is hoping this posting can shed some light....

For my background, I work as a paramedic in a busy urban emergency transport system

With acute moderate to severe asthma patients, is CPAP (not BiPAP) indicated for these patients?

My thought process is that because asthma patients are experiencing air trapping and mucus accumulation, CPAP would further worsen the symptoms. BiPAP has the ability to ease up during exhalation therefore allowing the patient to let air escape, unlike CPAP with its continuous pressure that is exerted.

Although asthma has some characteristics similar to COPD, there are subtle differences that I feel would not benefit asthma patients.

Any beneficial information one way or another would be great. Thanks all!",1

On the day I quit though, my body entirely shut down. I couldn't physically move faster than a sluggish walk, could barely speak and had a very muted freak out because I couldn't feel anything emotionally. I became a shell of a person in a matter of minutes and when my boss found me looking cloudy eyed in the bathroom suggested that perhaps this job wasn't the healthiest for me.

Anyway I feel like shit now. I always seem to after doctors appointments. I think I am just that nervous and anxious that it takes everything out of me. Plus it was my second appointment this week.

Came in due to hematuria (blood in urine) for a few days without pain that just went back to normal as suddenly as it came. This happened to me half a year ago as well but didn't go to the hospital that time.

We joke that the internet always says you have cancer, but the doc said the same thing I got from Google. Hematuria could be arguably nothing (just got red from food, kidney stone, UTI), or could be life-changingly-horrifyingly EVERYTHING (bladder cancer)

In fact, the doc says hematuria *without* pain can be even more concerning, which is what I experienced. No pain, just blood.

The spleen ruptured as soon as they touched it. They were able to control the bleeding, the surgery went well otherwise, and he's awake. I was literally days from a far more serious and harrowing emergency vet visit. But he's OK.

Nicotine amplifies the euphoria of success I feel.

Weed slows my brain. Adderall/blow speeds it up too much. Alcohol inhibits good judgement. LSD is a wild card. I won't do coke while I read, smoke weed while I program, or do acid before an important meeting. But I can vape almost anytime. Nicotine is absolutely perfect.

It shouldnt. i just feel like i feel alone when it comes to my opinion. everyone dies in the end as it is. death shouldnt have more of an emotional impact on someone JUST because its from cancer. thats just how i see it.

Hopefully this post is allowed. 

So, long story short, my ex-partner/best friend and I have co patented the cutest cat named Morrissey. I don‚Äôt live with them anymore but they both remain huge parts of my life. Morrissey was a flame point Siamese cat and she was 7 years old, turning 8 this year. 

Sadly, she was diagnosed with cancer earlier this week and passed away this weekend. Even though I don‚Äôt live with them anymore, Morrissey is one of the best friends and one of the greatest loves of my life. I miss her so much and I‚Äôve been crying almost non-stop.

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has ever lost a pet before and if so, how have you coped?",1

I wanna be with her but I can‚Äôt kms. That‚Äôll just make it worse for my family. I miss her so much. I just wish I kissed her in the head before we left the vet and told her I loved her one last time. I just wanna go back to when she didn‚Äôt have cancer and make her stay that way forever and live with us forever. But die once we die so she won‚Äôt be lonely. Gosh I‚Äôm gonna cry while writing this. I miss you so much (not saying her name for my privacy). I normally don‚Äôt talk about my problems because they really don‚Äôt matter. People have it way worse so I just don‚Äôt say anything about them. I‚Äôm sorry but I needed to say something now about how I feel and finally let my feelings out.,1

"My dad had to switch cancer medications. My dad has had cancer for several years now. He recently had to switch his medication and go back to infusions, so he's pretty depressed, and I dont know how to help him. How would you cheer up a loved one even if you couldn't really 'help'?",2
"A question to only child‚Äôs: what did you love or miss not having a sibling? My partner and I have a 4 month old daughter. We are 33 and 32. We are having a tough time deciding if we want to have another in the future. Neither of us were financially independent until about 25. That makes us creeping up on 60 while still supporting our child, assuming they have the same style of path as us.

We both had siblings. She was and still is very close to hers (lost a sister to cancer). My family had love for each other but we all have gone our separate ways and only get in touch every now and then.

I don‚Äôt know many people who had no siblings growing up...

What were your lives like?",2
"Today I get checked for skin cancer, but my day is going great so far and I am excited for the holidays! What are you looking forward for the holidays? I sold my car a few years back because we were busy paying for my husband's cancer bills. This led me to walk everywhere in Sunny California, including picking up my daughter from school. I either have sun damage or skin cancer, but I have great legs! We find out today whatever it is.

I hope whatever it is I have is treatable. I have fantastic insurance (thanks, Obama).

I am looking forward to taking my daughter to the snow for Christmas. She does not want presents, she wants snow!

Are you doing anything special for the holidays? Bonus if you provide a fun recipe for me to try! ",2
"What's your biggest success this past week? It's important for us to purposefully and authentically take time to acknowledge the successes in our lives, however small. Regular reflection makes it easier to activate our metacognitive knowledge and can put ourselves in a generally positive mindset. 

For me, I just hit my 5 year cancer-free mark. I had leukemia (aml - was extremely aggressive and I was given little chance of survival), and I'm so happy that I'm out of it for 5 years now. I often reflect about the very hard times, the myeloablative chemo rounds, rounds of total body radiation, bone marrow transplant...and here I am. I'm so thankful and happy. 

I never wish any of those hardships on another human, but I hope people are able to learn, reflect, and acknowledge our successes in life, because that certainly helped me.",2
My mother is going in for cancer surgery today looking to kill some time About 3 months ago my mother went for a mammogram and found out that she had two tumors one was Stage 2 and the other one was borderline stage 3 so today she's in to get a double lumpectomy and I'm sitting here trying to think of other things to do so I thought why not start a conversation,2
"I just found out that it's incredibly likely that I have cancer... It's likely that I have ovarian cancer. And I can't say that I'm really surprised. I go in for an ultrasound tomorrow. Part of me wants to break down and just fall apart. But the other part, the bigger part of me, that has taken over the past few weeks, just refuses to acknowledge the fact. Tonight, things are harder than they have been other nights and I'm sitting with my beer, feeling like I should cry, all alone, and wondering ""Where do I go from here?"" I'm 22 and haven't even begun to live the life I've dreamed of.

"How's your year going? 2020 has been terrible so far. My grandmother passed, my girlfriend left me, and my mom's cancer returned after years of remission. But also, really good things have happened. 

I got my first internship for my major and found that I love it even more than I knew, I got a job on campus during the next school year to pay my loans and have spending money, and I've made friends with people I would've missed out on if not for quarantine. Plus, I remembered my cake day this year!

This year so far has been really hard, but I'm still feeling optimistic about what the future will look like. So, how's your year going?",2

I'm just such an impulsive talker. And then we don't discuss it because it's an awkward thing to talk about. ",2
"Last night I found out my Dad has cancer. I apologize if this is too serious for this community, but I love this community and just wanted to share. No one in my family has ever had cancer, so this is a shock to my mom, my sister and me. He went into surgery for a lump on his neck that was supposed to be nothing and after the surgery they said they saw signs of cancer. We're still waiting for lab results and a scan to be scheduled. There's so much I don't know. So much waiting. My mom isn't handling it well, but on the flip side, my Dad seems to actually be doing alright. But maybe he's just being stubborn and in denial. It's hard to tell. I live 350 miles away, it's hard feeling like there's nothing I can do. ",2

"Just remembered that iv forgotten my mum's laugh Long story short, I was 9 when my mum passed from cancer. And my Nana showed me a video from when I was 1 and 2 years of age. My mum was in those videos, and she was laughing, and smiling, and she was so happy and pretty. I can't help but feel guilty that iv forgotten her laugh, the sound of it, her voice, how beautiful it sounded.

He had retired 3 or 4 years ago with his wife.

Goodbye, Mr. Thurn. We'll miss you.",2
Here's to 2019 being over. 2019 was probably one of the worst years I've had. My mom got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer( thankfully she is doing well and it isnt life threatening right now) she cant work anymore which takes a good chunk of my income. Then my gf of 5 years broke up with me. Dating is really tough and I'm not really good at it. I'm lonely and bored. So let's chat. 27(Male) if you care to know.,2
"Hey everyone, I(M 20) know this isn't big, but I just went and adopted my first dog on my own! So, last February of 2019 my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and we were at risk of being evicted by out landlord, so we had to give my first dog( who's name is dog) to my brother in Utah where he is living with him forever. Things have been hard without a dog by my side to make me happy and take on walks, until today I went and adopted a 2 year old lab retriever from my local rescue shelter. I cried because she is so cute, and I will finally have a new companion by my side. I know this isn't a big deal to some people but it really just makes me so happy! She's getting fixed at the moment, and I get to bring her home tomorrow :)",2
"I'm getting vaccinated tommorow! Okay so hear this one out, my parents are the most PRO vax people around. When I was 9, I was diagnosed with hodgkins lymphoma, a tumour based cancer. After 9 months of chemo and radiation therapy, I was happily in remission. However, something chemo does when you get treated is it clears your immune system (most of the time) and it had cleared out my whole immune system 

What was supposed to happen was I should have been sent for vaccination boosters a couple months after remission. Never happened. After my dad inquired to the doctors about a measles outbreak a few towns over recently, the doctors realized, I had never been vaccinated again. I have living my life for 7 whole years unvacced! I was terrified and my parents were so damn mad, especially because they are so pro vax. It took a week for the shots to arrive and they are finaly here! Tommorow I get to start my re-immunization program and I couldnt be happier.",2
"Having possibly my worst ever day at work this evening. Just need someone to talk to... I work in customer service at a pharmacy and I've never seen so many rude, stupid, and picky people.

EDIT: Going back up front. I'll keep everyone posted. Again, thanks for lending your ears :)

EDIT #2: When I came back, I got called to the office. I didn't know what to expect, but my shift supervisor asked me what was wrong and I told her the situation about my grandpa. To my surprise, she allowed me to go home early to sort myself out, and asked me to keep her posted about everything. I feel bad for leaving her hanging, but I'm so grateful she was so understanding.",2
"I am the first person in my family to graduate university thanks to my mom My dad died when I was 2 years old from cancer and ever since my mother was a single mother. We were a poor family where my mother took care of my sister and I alone, working several jobs to buy clothing, to buy us what wanted and to feed my sister and I. She always put in the strong and happy face however she was stressed and tired but never showed us that face. I‚Äôve always wanted help her relieve that stress and hardship she has by getting a job, she wouldn‚Äôt let me. All she wanted is for me to study and be happy, she was willing to sacrifice her life for mine and my sisters life. So I did want she told me. Now, I am a university graduate with a electrical engineering degree in engineering. When my mom saw me in that black gown and a cap her face showed genuine happiness. Thank you mom for supporting me and thank you for sacrificing your life to help mine and my sisters, it is my turn to make you happy.",2
"This has been my personal hardest 6 months and it's not getting easier Since the end of May I have lost both of my grandmothers, my grandfather now has aggressive prostate cancer, my mom has developed nerve damage from a surgery and to top it all off I moved states and away from all my family and friends to start an insanely stressful job.

I'm waiting to hear about vet school applications which was extremely stressful too and I'm about to have no place to live. I only make 11 dollars an hour and I simply can't afford a new place. I'm almost thinking about packing up my things and moving back in with my parents like a failure

It's been about 3¬Ω years since I've finished treatment, but it's the worse thing that's ever happened to me, and the emotional and physical pain it caused was unimaginable, especially for a 7/11 year old. 

He doesn't seem to get this though, calling me things like ""[Op]'s cancer bitch ass"" and ""Cancer kid"" behind my back.

I was doing some digging as it‚Äôs pretty rare and I discovered my grandmother had the same condition, she was a study nurse in the army in 1944 through 1965 she was stationed at a base in New Mexico near the Trinity testing site for nuclear weapons, while she was there her coworkers radiation poisoning and she didn‚Äôt. Later in her career she helped pioneer radiation therapy for cancer. Because of her unique condition she was able to be tested on for medical treatments.

Anyways when I had my yearly chekup at the doctors I asked them to check my blood and some days letter I got results and they were like ‚Äúyo you‚Äôre fine‚Äù

So I'm worried I have cancer or PCOS or both. I got. Blood test done a while back but doc never called me.

I never told a soul, to this day no one knows my dad had cancer.

I never felt the need to tell anyone, I forgot about it most of the time.

This was my final exam year before college too - so it was important and being old he had cancer had no affect on me..

He‚Äôs said to me how he was so worried we‚Äôd grow up without a father - not that he could die but that he wouldn‚Äôt get to see us grow into adults.
When he asked me about it I just said ‚Äòwell I mean the surgeon did a great job and you‚Äôre fine now‚Äô

"I didn't like my father in law until he got cancer [No Regrets] So I've been with my spouse for 11 years and things have always been touchy-at best-with his father. He's just a very gruff man, doesn't like to talk, and is just overall not nice. He's not mean, either....just not nice. 

About two months ago the FIL was diagnosed with a brain tumor, they operated within the week and removed a large mass from the back of his head. After the surgery his personality has done a complete 180. He is the friendliest, most engaging guy you'll ever meet. I know it was caused by the cancer but I feel like I finally like my FIL. He is still recovering from the surgery and struggles to find words sometimes, but I feel like I've had more meaningful conversations with him in the last 5 or so weeks since the operation, than I ever have the whole 11 years I've known him. I hope the personality change is permanent, even though he has a tough road ahead of him. ",2

She was lovely. Tried to be as upbeat as possible but admitted a few times, she wasn't sure. It could be cancer, but could also be benign. She has refered me for a breast check but I will be waiting a minimum 6 weeks, with the advice of 'try not to worry'.

That was seven months ago. 

Last week, we got a letter in the mail from the guy's sister. She said he had died of cancer and had wanted to leave a note for us.

Does anybody have any advice for how to combat this or any idea of what he may be going through?

"A thought about risk factors for poor outcomes in COVID-19 In China, their ICU teams found that patients who were older, had HTN, DM (presumably DM2), and CVD did very poorly (and cancer, but that‚Äôs easy to explain).  This raised a lot of speculation about the role of ACE2.

In Italy, reports were similar, but Italy is a western nation that looks more like the US than China.  They reported that the most common comorbidity was obesity.  They also reported severe glycemic disturbances with ketoacidosis.

And so this makes me think about this risk in a whole new light.  Hypertension and diabetes are hallmarks of the metabolic syndrome.  We know that the metabolic syndrome is a pro-inflammatory state.

And so my suspicion is that rather than something about ACE2, we are seeing a more fundamental dysregulation of the immune response.

What do you think?

"My stomach hurts and I cough so much, but... 
...my mom thinks I'm faking it. I said I am feeling bad and exhausted, but still got the ""faking"" argument. After a while I felt so bad that I runned to toilet and literally vomit all over it.
I tried to relax a little bit and take a nap, but I was heavily breathing. I had to clean toilet, that's for sure, but my mom STILL THINKS everything is alright. I tried to speak with her, but I got ignored. I feel bad as my mother seems not to care about me. Maybe she's in bad mood? I don't know.

Poland is in yellow zone (3k c0v1d positive tests/24 hours) since Saturday and I am not sure about walking in mask for whole day with such diseases.


I do not want to vomit in school or cough, because C0V1D and I don't want my family closed in quarantine. How can I convince my mom to make her atleast worried a little bit?
Or should I say about it to my father?

TL;DR I feel so bad, but my mom says I'm fine, when I am not.",1

"I gave fake codeine to a friend One of the things to do during senior year at high school was to have house parties at my house. We would have some weed or some lean, nobody drank beer or did any serious drugs. We had music and Playstation.

One time, it was just me and my buddy after everyone left. We didn't get high yet so he asked if I could make him lean (it's basically cough syrup with codeine and sprite and food color.) I opened the fridge and there was two bottles of cough syrup, one with codeine and one without. Codeine was the thing that got you high. So I made mine with the good stuff but I used the cough syrup without codeine for my friend to see if he would act high.

After a while, we finished the drinks. I was a little drowsy but he was on another level. Trying to talk slowly with a rough voice and dropped his eyes low. He was like ""damn, that was some good lean, I got waay f*cked up."" and then he left and I was screaming and laughing so hard till my mom came home.",1

I keep bursting into tears because I feel so crappy and like I'm never his priority. I thought that pregnancy would involve more close bonding time together and being excited about the baby but so far I have felt very alone in this journey. He hasn't acknowledged the pregnancy on social media, put together any nursery furniture, purchased anything for the baby. I had to really push the point to get him to take a few hours off work to come to the 20 week morphology scan. I asked him to make a doctor's appointment to get a whooping cough vaccination and I'm certain he's forgotten/hasn't thought about it since.",1

The last time I vomited was last year and I was shaking uncontrollably as I felt my esophagus get shorter and shorter. Tears were streaming down my face and finally I just said, ""this is it.""

"I don't want to donate blood but force myself to Yesterday I donated blood for the second time and as soon as the needle was out of me I felt dizzy and lightheaded. Despite having several piercings my fear of needles is still there. I could not breath and a nurse made me cough into a paper bag until I felt like vomiting. I am so thankful the experienced nurses had a trash can ready and I am so grateful I made it into the trash can. 

I felt embarrassed not only from vomiting but I felt like I was discouraging other already nervous patients about to donate blood. The nurses are always so sweet and I stayed for an hour until I was good to drive home. I don't want to donate or go through that ever again but since I have the universal donor blood type I feel obligated to. It would be selfish for me not to go through a little bit of pain for someone who may be suffering way more.

However he likes to think of himself as the alpha male and for this reason I can't hang out with the rest of my friends without him being there. He isn't a horrible person as such but he lacks the basic traits of being a good which makes me not want to hang around with him.

Nearly every night I hear him go into a coughing fit, and for the longest time I thought it was due to his asthma, or a consequence of sleeping with the AC and fan facing him.

I did not know the doctor gave me an RX for it because she spoke no English and called the drug a different name. Long story short, I went to two doctors a week later and got more bottles of codeine.

"Why does coughing cause a drop in MAP? I‚Äôm a medical student currently volunteering as a bedside nurse in ICU. Whenever a patient isn‚Äôt fully sedated and I attempt to suction the trach (SG or below the epiglottis), their MAP drops by 15-20 which is concerning since it‚Äôs around 60 to begin with. 

What‚Äôs the mechanism by which this happens? Does a cough increase intrathoracic pressure and reduce venous return to the heart, thereby reducing CO transiently? I haven‚Äôt been able to find much on this, presumably because coughing in a healthy person doesn‚Äôt bring about a clinically important change in MAP.

Also, if anyone has experience with these patients, how significant would the drop in MAP need to be for me to get worried? I‚Äôm scared of SG aspiration unsupervised now because of how their cough reflex will trigger a fall in BP and the ECMO/Vitals monitor to start beeping like crazy. But I also want to be able to provide this care confidently.

I told myself to ignore it yesterday but right now as I was applying lotion on the mirror I jumped up because the throat noise got so fucking loud next to my door. This is why I keep thinking about getting a white noise machine.,1
"Coronavirus anxiety How do I help myself with this? It's getting close to my country and just dropping social media won't help me because I here about it everywhere in public. I get tense as soon as I feel like coughing once or my nose is runny. I'm aware there's less risk for me because I'm young, generally healthy and a non-smoker and I'm aware that the media tends to blow everything out of proportion, especially these days, but I'm at uni for the entire day and I feel this constant sense of high anxiety that I'm supposed to hide so I don't disturb others. Anyone got any psychological tricks to calm myself down?",1
"My sister My sister is 10F, adopted 3 years and when she got her privileges taken away for the evening for farting in my face (at about 7 PM bedtime 8:30 PM) She started bawling repeatedly screaming and sobbing ""HELLLP"" and ""PLEEASE"" for about more than a half an hour or so. She's also been hyperventilating, coughing, disobeying and flailing limbs around and this has been happening repeatedly for the years she's been with us.

She was taken away from her alcoholic mom at age 3 and was passed through families until age 7.

We think there's something wrong, can I have help?",1
"Help to diagnosis: Specific Activities Leading to Physical Symptoms Hi,  
I suffer from some specific physical symptoms (coughing, diarrhea) and impaired cognitive function after doing some specific activities e.g. computer programming, studying specific subjects (e.g. advanced math) and hard physical activities.  
I haven't been able to put a diagnosis to this link between activities and symptoms, and thereby not been able to recover. **I hope for your help to point me in a direction to find a diagnosis or an effective recovering strategy/method.**

I started having these symptoms during my time at the university. They were intensified during my (stressful) final thesis (constant diarrhea and coughing leading to daily vomiting).  
It is now four years since I graduated. The symptoms have slightly eased, primarily because I avoid the activities that trigger the symptoms. This also means that I avoid specific activities that I used to love, which is unfulfilling.

Thanks in advance, M.",1
"I've ""attempted"" multiple times today but the feeling is so awful that I don't follow through I'm not doing so good. I can't even tell how serious I am. I've sort of tried hanging by partial suspension but that feeling when my air is cut off and I immediately want to cough, which makes me gag, forces me out of it. I think I would rather something instantaneous so that I can't change my mind. But I don't have anything like that. 

I asked my mother to take me to the CSU (crisis stabilization unit) and then she saw me and angrily asked, ""Do you want me to take you to the CSU now?"" I don't think they take anything I say seriously anymore. She didn't ask me any questions. I must be a bother she eagerly wants to get rid of. So now I'm locked it my room typing this right after trying partial suspension again.

"Health anxiety In 2017 my (21, F) Dad died of a rare form of throat cancer and the following year my auntie (who had lived with us my whole life) died of liver cancer. One thing I remember about them being ill is they both had such bad coughs, especially my Dad. My dads cancer also made it hard for him to swallow phlegm meaning he had a lot of it coming up. 
Now days I can‚Äôt stand the sound of other people coughing, especially those I love like my mum and boyfriend. My boyfriends had a cold the past few weeks and I find myself feeling constantly anxious of hearing him cough or even sniff. It ends up with me getting angry with him which I know is stupid because he can‚Äôt help sniffing.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm hyperaware that I‚Äôm alive and at any moment I could die.

"Sometimes I can't keep certain thoughts from becoming spoken words. This happens when my thoughts are roaming, usually during menial tasks, and I think about something I regret doing.  The words that come out are usually along the lines of ""stupid f#$&ing idiot"", ""Piece of s#%"" or something to that effect.  What's unusual about this is that I don't seem to have much control over it.  When it happens it just happens without any prior intention of doing so, however, it's not debilitating and the physical manifestation is not completely uncontrollable.   If it's in a social setting I can keep the words to a whisper and try to cover it up with a cough or  but a physical reaction always happens whether I want it to or not.  When I suppress it I end up grinding my teeth really bad.  I'm probably just cringing which is obviously normal, but it doesn't feel normal.  This has been a noticeable thing since I was a teenager and I'm 37 now.  Am I just overreacting about this?",1
Anyone please help I feel like I‚Äôm drowning in myself. Every day when I go to get in bed I think about death. I think about not seeing colors and not breathing. It‚Äôs dark and cold.

I‚Äôm scared that if I keep feeling this way every day it is slowly going to consume me and I might take my life one day. I can‚Äôt seem to stop thinking about death. Usually when I think about it I feel like screaming but instead I just give this dry cough as loud as I can it seems to help. When I first started thinking about death I would run from my room to the kitchen across the house and burst into tears and cry with my head on the refrigerator. ,1
"What happened to me? I've been kind of wondering for a while what happened on the day I finally decided to quit my job.
I had, had a series of break downs during shifts after suffering from some form of asthma aggravated lung issue. My stress and anxiety were through the roof and I had cried on multiple occasions both before and after getting help for me coughing.
On the day I quit though, my body entirely shut down. I couldn't physically move faster than a sluggish walk, could barely speak and had a very muted freak out because I couldn't feel anything emotionally. I became a shell of a person in a matter of minutes and when my boss found me looking cloudy eyed in the bathroom suggested that perhaps this job wasn't the healthiest for me. She was great and helped me after several of my breakdowns. To this day I'm not sure what to say happened.

Its odd because as far as i know he has never committed a crime. Then 2 days ago i had another nightmare. This one is more vivid. It was christmas, and my sister was coughing. She ended up dying too.  Something odd about both these dreams is i didnt witness the deaths, i was told about them. They also felt very real for dreams. Im worried that im becoming a psychopath.

I get ill every winter at least once, but this year is a nightmare. (At least I didn‚Äôt get the nasty thing that‚Äôs everywhere right now, thank you vaccinations.)

I cannot be the only one ill - how is everyone else?",2
"Personal Apocalypse Life, as I know it, is over. My apartment is clean as I lay on the bed, sick, and coughing.

""Suppose I will have to look for food elsewhere"", I think, and get up to grab water.

""I failed my degree, I failed my life, I gave up on every hope and dream"", I sing, and take a sip. Then I turn on some relaxed music to relax to. Soft saxophone notes fill the air as I watch the stars.

""They were right to call me the next in line to fail, as all who tried before me"", I sigh, and stretch. Whatever.",2
"It‚Äôs half last 3 in the morning and I‚Äôm up with my eldest child I think he has croup, which sucks. I didn‚Äôt know grown up children (he‚Äôs almost 14) could still get it. There‚Äôs not a huge amount you can do about it, he‚Äôs got cough lozenges, had Panadol, I‚Äôve sat him in a steamy bathroom because I don‚Äôt have a humidifier anymore. So now we‚Äôre just chilling while he tries to sleep and I keep him company.    


The worst part is I‚Äôm training someone at work, tomorrow is their second day so I can‚Äôt have time off. If it keeps raining his dad might not be working so hopefully he can go there, otherwise he might have to chill at home with his step dad (not a huge issue as he is self employed and is based at home in the workshop but does go out on call outs as required).   


It‚Äôs like listening to a 90 year old man breathing his last breaths.    


Anyone awake out there?",2
Well that's it Christmas ruined by sickness. I hadn't felt great for a week building up and felt rough Christmas eve night. Was going to go out but stayed in. At about 4 o clock Christmas day I began to get sleepy and had nowhere to rest but the floor so my mum suggested that I go rest in bed. Next thing I know I wake up having a coughing fit and my head spinning and my entire body feeling like it was being pricked by kneedles. My sister found it hilarious as she believed that I had to much to drink. Every so often she would run into my room with a torch and I'd yell. I then spent boxing day on and off of sleep I may have had many hours of sleep in that time by now. Hopefully tonight I will be able to go out and salvage some kind of enjoyment out of the Christmas period. But who knows. I feel a bit better now but this thing seems to come and go.,2
"I'm sick in bed, but thankful I have a support network. Like, sure, I'm laid up with some cough, body chill, fever throat thing, but I'm ok.

I can get. Doctors appointment, quickly and subsidised if needed. I have legislated sick days I can take if needed. I've got food, and don't need to worry about spending a day watching tv.

Thinking about places where this isn't a thing, just because of lack of resource, or systematic restrictions, and I can't help but be thankful.",2

"[Light] I coughed up blood for three days. (a little gross) I never told anyone. I was on vacation with my best friend and it didn't really affect me, except occasionally I would get this feeling in the back of my throat and I'd excuse myself to the bathroom to cough up blood. In the mornings, it was quite a significant amount, so I assume for whatever reason I was bleeding when I was asleep. I'm not sure why, but I did attend a family dinner with a very unsanitary little cousin who had bronchitis the week before. Maybe that was it?

Anyways, I feel sorta bad because my health may have been at risk. I've been to a regular doctor's checkup since that time and he said I'm fine. I didn't mention the coughing up blood. ",2
"[Light] I always mask my sneeze with a cough. I'm not too interested in random people saying ""bless you"" every time I sneeze. So to cover that up and the embarrassment, I always time my cough perfectly so nobody knows I've sneezed. Been doing it since I was 10 and it is fantastic.",2

After the guy finishes they pass it around till I get it. I thought, ""I wanna make a good first impression and hit this like a truck."" I took the biggest hit I could take and didn't cough. Until a minute later. I was coughing until we left. I thought I left reality. When we got back home there was pizza. I was high af so you know I had the munchies. I went straight for the pizza but my cousin said to go upstairs. I was like, bruh, no. I went upstairs anyway and came back down a few minutes later and ate like 4 slices before going upstairs and passing out. The end.",2

You roll your eyes and silently mutter something I couldn't make out, but I was definite it was towards me.

"[Light] The simple pleasure of sinus infections [Light]
A couple years back I didn't have health insurance and I was sick. I mean, really really sick. I had an ear infection in both ears and probably the worst sinus infection I've had in my life; it was pretty terrible and nothing I could do would make me feel better. 

So, one day I get in the shower and have the urge to cough and I hack up this gigantic, pog-sized hard mass of blood and gross and what I presume was hardened phlegm. It was like I coughed out a rock. I remember looking at it in utter fascination and just holding it like I had created something fantastic. It was the turning point in my sickness. 

Now, I find myself really, really missing being so sick because hacking out that giant ball of gunk was one of the most satisfying non-sexual pleasures I've experienced in my life. I find myself purposefully avoiding going to the doctor or getting help in hopes of chasing that giant phlegm ball high",2
"I get slightly happy when my sister feels pain. I really just can't stand her. She chews like a pig, gets offended by everything, and is very arrogant. She's 22 but wheres a rainbow robe and loves little girl shit. She doesn't care about anybody's opinion and thinks she's always right. The reason I feel slightly bad is that she has Crohn's disease. She feels pain a lot and has to be driven to the hospital on multiple occasions. Right now she's on crutches but I enjoy it when she isn't able to walk. This is also partially due to her constantly teasing me about my weight which I am very insecure about. I smile when I see her cry due to the internal pain and one time I even laughed for a split second (which I turned into a cough).

A couple of years ago, I forgot exactly what happened but I remember I punched her really hard. With her frail body it hurt a lot. To this day every time I remember her scream/cry she made, I smile. ",2

When I hear someone coughing or clearing their throat, sometimes in my family I will burst out loud to stop that when I don't know about that. It is really affecting my relationship with my parents and sibling there.  When I hear some of those sounds I don't like, I just want to go into my room to clear the sound of the noise in my head. Whenever I'm sleeping near someone, I will always tend to cover my ears when I sleep so I don't hear the clicking sounds from the teeth. My parents ask me why I do this and I tell them that I feel comfortable doing this and I feel better doing that. If I don't do that when I'm trying to sleep, Thoughts will be spiraling in my head about what if that person does these noises. Is this a pet peeve or something bigger?",2

Thanks to anyone reading this today. I hope your day was as good as mine!",2
"Can I hear some stories about people with rough childhoods, or who've struggled with depression, who ended up ok? I'm sorry if this is too serious for casual conversation, most of the subs aimed towards sad topics are full of other sad people, it's a self-perpetrating loop of unhappiness. We don't need to go into loads of sad details, in fact I'd rather hear about the good things. Just please assure me it's possible to have your life turn around, to genuinely enjoy it. 

I don't have a story myself, hence why I'm asking for them, but I will say - when I get to a point where I think I have made it, I'm going to hang my dragon wind chime in my garden. Then maybe I'll be able to tell other people who're feeling helpless about that moment and how life got better for me.",1
Do you believe that we are soon gonna be in a economic depression similar in some ways to “The Great Depression”? Or is this just a hard hit to the economy that we can overcome? Please no political talk! Unless if it’s non biased. I’m here to see what people think of this not candidate vs candidate. Thank you!,1
"Just discovered a couple of Rory Gallagher songs in midst of depression It’s a great feeling when you discover something absolutely that literally reaches your heart 

I always Rory was kind of a heavy 60s rockstar like Hendrix with a bit of acoustic blues. 

But today, I, for some reason, tuned into *Edged in Blue* and boy was that some music. Soft, melodic and simply beautiful 

Then came *A Million Miles Away* and these two songs will loop for the next two months in my playlist",1
"Today, after 3-4 months of constant depression and anxiety today I am at piece Even tho it was for a short moment my mind was quiet and I was happy with myself 

Got no one to tell this(and my next therapy session is in 2 weeks) so here I am",2
"I've exercised for one full month now. So yeah I've exercised for one full month now. Nobody cares but I just felt like sharing it here. I started on the first of February and from that day i started exercising for two hours per day. 30 minutes running, 30 minutes weights, 30 minutes yoga, 30 minutes swimming. 

I'm glad that i actually started exercising because I had a lot of health issues in 2020. I had a heart-attack, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I have anxiety, depression, and taking medication for it.

But ever since I've been exercising a bit it's been helpful. I used to have thoughts of ending myself and losing hope, violent thoughts etc.

But I'm better now and I actually realize how beautiful life is. 

So life's good, life is good.",2
"I'm going to see my doctor Monday about anxiety and depression. I recently have been having panic attacks. Never had them before this year. 3-4 months back they just started out of nowhere. Some are as small as a few minutes and only being a symptom or 2. Then sometimes, they are as bad as 15-20 minutes with just about every symptom and feeling as if I am going to die.

This is hard for me to talk about. I have a pretty good life. A loving wife, two beautiful children and even though I'm not a big fan of the company I work for, I do enjoy what I do. So it's easy for me to question why is this happening to me?

 I've never been diagnosed with depression but I did finally admit to the ER doctor that I have had thoughts of self harm. I hate having the panic attacks and I hope I get the help I need. I need to work on talking about it openly because I literally feel so alone.",2
"I just showered for the first time in a week after fighting depression I know this is probably a minuscule thing to be excited over (or at least that's how my family sees it) but I'm proud of myself and wanted to tell somebody. 

A lot of the time, people don't realize how much depression can take a toll on somebody. My sleep schedule went haywire, I went days eating too little or eating too much, yadda yadda. I don't want to be a debbie downer but I hope this can spark a conversation or two! :)",2
"After being off for a month with depression, today I finally went back to work and made it through the whole day. Without any wobbles too! It might not sound like much, but getting through today was a very big achievement for me, as I'm still really struggling with my depression and have lost nearly all of my confidence. 
If anyone's been through something similar, I'd love to hear some advice/tips on how to deal with work and depression. Or feel free to share your stories too!",2
"Realized my depression is cured today After months of being depressed endlessly, and not finding joy in the joyful things of life, I decided to listen to some music today and actually found it nice to listen to. I then watched a show and laughed for the first time in a while. Anyways I just wanted to tell someone.",2
"I can’t stop low-key smiling In December 2019, I quit my job of 1.5 years because it was affecting my mental health and started my own company. As of January 2021, I have successfully made my company survive the pandemic and made profits. I also clarified my relationship with my SO and for the first time in my life I feel like things are good and that all the efforts I have put and all the shit I have gone through was worth it. I feel like I am in a good place and just wanted to share it. I do not have a lot of friends because I suffer from chronic depression and have alienated a lot of people over the years. But today while writing this I feel hopeful and optimistic.",2
"Why does it feel like over half the posts on this sub are about people’s depression? Not trying to be rude or anything but depression isn’t a casual conversation and if you are having a bad day and just want to chat then I don’t see why you can’t do so without outright mentioning your depression. 

There are plenty of other subs for helping people with depression and the like. This is not one of them in my opinion.",1
"I finally cleaned my room after a few years of hard depression due to a chair I bought from Goodwill! I found a beautiful mauve/dusty rose chair from Goodwill yesterday. I didn’t get it then because I was with my friend who has a regular car. So I picked up my friend today in my SUV and we went back to goodwill for the chair. 

Originally, my plan was to sneak it into my parent’s house and hope they don’t notice but my friend said, “why don’t we clean your room instead?” 

We did it! I already got rid of a lot of clothes during quarantine already but I found even more stuff to get rid of! I honestly wouldn’t have been able to clean without the help of someone. I have had very low motivation for a couple years now (on things in the house not my work) and it just feels so good to have more floor space! We even cleaned and disinfected the chair while we were at it! It unfortunately has to stay outside for a couple days though. 

Anyways, I just really wanted to share this somewhere!",2
"I'm helping a person with depression and its making me happy seeing him happy So I had made a post on r/teenagers yesterday when I had gotten a DM from a fellow that wanted to talk about his personal issues. It turns out he seems sad and doesn't really have feelings for others. He had recently taken up cutting. It scared me when he first said it but we started talking when then I had to go (It was 3:AM so I had to sleep obviously) he had sent me more messages today and we talked a little more about his feelings and such when he said something I probably will never forget. ""I haven't cut myself since the last time we talked."" I was so relieved to know he hadn't done it at all between the two times we talked. I'm just so happy to see him legitimately sharing his feelings and opinions on his view of everything.


Tl:dr I helped a person that was depressed and stopped him from cutting for a full 24 hours
Thank you for reading",2
"I’ve been taking my antidepressants for a month now and I think I’m starting to feel better I’ve always described my depression as feeling like there’s a cat on my chest. It’s the pressure, and it’s hard to take a full breath, but it’s oddly warm and comforting because it’s been there so long. 

I think the cat’s gone? I woke up today and didn’t dread going to work. I put on makeup because I wanted to, and actually thought it looked good instead of critiquing it in my head. 

It’s refreshing not feeling like I’m underwater anymore, and I really hope this feeling lasts.",2
"I'm starting to come out of a multi-year long depression, and I want friends to share my new happiness with Like the title says, I'd love to find some kind friends to message regularly just to share my new happy moments with. Right now I don't have anyone to talk to but my wife, no friends or family. I'd like to change that by finding folks with similar interests, likes to chat often like I do, likes to share memes and recent news and cool facts. So let's chat and become friends, because as it stands right now, I don't have any.",2
"A doggo a day, keeps the depression away I’ve been having bad days recently with a spike in anxiety and depression. I haven’t been sleeping well to say the least.

But my doggo, a small yorkie pupper, just jumped into bed and came to lay her head on my leg.

Feeling her small chin resting on my thigh and her warm little body leaning against mines just warms my heart.

I’m so grateful for her company.

What did we ever do to deserve such wonderful hairy companions?",2
"My best friend gave me one of the most uplifting compliments I've ever received. He told me, 'I don't know why, but I've found a kindred spirit in you.'

I struggle with depression and low self-esteem, and I often fear that I'm a burden and a nuisance to my friends, and that they don't really like me and only talk to me out of pity. So when he said that, it was very heartening. I'm glad that there's someone who feels that much of a connection with me and appreciates my personality, even if I don't myself.",2
"I just deleted my Twitter account and I feel so much better already. That place is a cesspool of hatred and I don't need more of that in my life already. It was making my (already pretty bad) depression magnitudes worse. Just deactivating it makes me feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Admittedly not a big one, but a weight nonetheless.",2
"Does anyone have dreams so surreal and lucid, leaves you a feeling of nostalgia and sort of depression for the rest of the day? ",1
"I’m moving soon, maybe, and I’m very nervous I have been wanting to move to a place that allows dogs. But I’m single, don’t want room mates, and it’s been impossible to find a place because of that that is in my price range

I Finally may have found a place that’s a little higher than I want, but it’s the closest thing I’ve been able to find. It’s not perfect by any means but they allow dogs of all kinds and cats so I I’m going to be able to get a dog in the very near future. I’m SO excited but so nervous Because I don’t do well with drastic change but I know I need to move. I’ve been in the same apartment for four years now and just need some thing a little bigger. I have pretty significant anxiety and depression so I think a dog will help me get outside a lot more as well.",2
How do you help a depressed person? I found out my dear aunt has major depression and i am heartbroken.she is 38 years old and she is the kindest and most selfless person i have ever known.she is so beautiful and fit and she has always helped me through the hardest times in my life.i always though of her as an strong independant woman.she has two beautiful daughters.one of them is in first grade and the other is in forth grade.i want to help her but i just don't know what to do because she always acts like everything is perfect and she always smiles and doesn't talk much about her problems.what should i do to help her??,2
"I took today off to clean my house, because it needs it so desperately: my depression manifests in low energy and lots of executive function issues. Send me good vibes! What is your sure fire way to motivate yourself? I think a little my favorite murder and changing my scents around the house will help me keep going. It also helps that I don’t like the episode of supernatural that is on. :) 
Happy Thursday friends!",2
"21 I just feel like giving up on one of the last dreams I had and could use a friend I've had plenty of issues in my life. I'm not going to go into them right now, but they really are not a lot of fun. I've given up on most of my dreams and now I'm vaguely considering giving up on one of the  last ones. I've wanted to go to uni in Denmark for a long time, but my grade really suck. My parents divorce and depression definitely didn't help. I don't want to give up, but if I do fail my family will use it against me when they do something they don't like. They'll say it was stupid to try and I wasted my time. Maybe giving up this one final dream is for the best, but it's one that would be very hard to let go of. Anyways...

 I'd like to have a nice friendly chat about something nice. I could use a friend and could use some help focusing on something a bit happier.",2
"So I finally did a pushup today. Been trying to since july After over coming my depression and suicidal tendencies with some help from working out, I got serious about it and decided to lose weight. I weighed 120ish kgs(265 lbs) at the start of my journey and I'm now at 95 kgs (209 lbs). Nowhere near the weight loss that I'm satisfied by. But today I achieved a milestone that is a solid sign of progress being made. I was able to do 4 full pushups in a row. That's a big deal for me. The first time I've ever been able to do pushups in my life. Been obses since childhood so it's something that I had only seen other people do it. I wasn't even able to do half pushups in the beginning. I only do bodyweight workouts because of the lockdown so I don't have any access to gyms and weights. That's why my progress is slow but it's still progress made and that's something to me. I had no one to share so I thought I'd put up a post here. Thanks for reading:)",2
"Things to do for people with no friends? What is something I can do to keep myself entertained when I have no friends? I’m not talking about those people that say they have no friends but they actually have a few people that hang out with them here and there. I literally have zero friends.

For the record, 25F, all I do now is work (part time) and when I’m not working, I watch TV from when I wake up to when I sleep, and I go to the gym and run 2 times a week outdoors; which only takes 2 hours of my day. I try to look for hobbies but I can’t find anything. I feel like it’s giving me major depression because I feel so useless and boring and antisocial (I don’t choose to be antisocial, I just can’t seem to make friends), but I do get a anxiety from going out alone. So, good people of Reddit, what can you recommend that I do to keep busy and productive without having friends?",2
"What’s the most random thing that impacted your life? In April 2013 I was on Omegle talking to random strangers. Long story short, one of those strangers became my boyfriend, moved in with me (he traveled 1400 miles) after only knowing me a month. He helped me finish school, helped me get my bipolar disorder stable. My now husband and I have been together almost 8 years! We are both a very happy couple. Before we found each other we both were miserable and had bad depression. Life is amazing now. All because we wanted to talk to random strangers.",2
"God I’m so socially rusty I just had my first FaceTime with friends in a long time and I could barely form coherent thoughts much less interesting remarks. I feel so cognitively slow from the almost 2 years of social isolation (persistent depression and covid). My friends were so high energy and enthusiastic and witty because they’ve maintained their social aptitude from returning their college campuses after they opened back up. In comparison, I’m just here like “wow that crazy” or “damn haha” I’ve become so dull and weird. My strained utterances lack substance and my brain is clearly impaired.",2
"I hear this song in my head during every bout of depression and anxiety attack (starting at 5:01) https://youtu.be/rYy0o-J0x20

It's almost 4am; I can't sleep so watched this for about the thousandth time. It's like a beautiful torture, I love it and Bo Burnham to pieces but when he sings *I should probably just shut up and do my job so here I go*, I come to tears because that's how it always feels...stop complaining, it's not that bad, other people have it worse, just ignore your depression and be happy. 

And I don't think that I can handle that right now.",2
"I Got A Diagnosis Today! I am recovering from brain trauma as I was involved in an accident a little over a year ago.  In addition to all of the physical and cognitive  impairments, I also have depression and anxiety.

Today my therapist said that I am exhibiting PTSD.  She then talked in detail about what it meant and she could help.  PTSD never even occurred to me.  I had previously thought that PTSD was what you saw in movies, I had never really associated my symptoms with it.

I really cannot explain why but getting that diagnosis was such an incredible self knowledge moment.  What I am experiencing and how I am behaving is very normal for people in traumatic incidents.  I am not crazy!!!  There is treatment and hope to help me and I do  not have to do it alone.  I do not just have to get over it, and constantly disappoint myself.

Honestly I am a little euphoric right now.  Glad to have a place to share!",2
"Tonight was my first night taking anxiety/depression meds I didn’t realize how much I needed it these past 5 years. I truly feel like my life has been changed forever. I can’t believe I’m not worried and fixated on anything, or feeling an uncontrollable spiraling emotional reaction to small things that don’t matter in the long run. My doctor hit this prescription right on the nose.

I don’t feel completely comfortable telling any of my friends right now, but I want to remember this moment. I want to feel like this forever.",2
"Any ideas on how to reach out to friends who I lost contact with years ago? So I have a couple of friends who I have not spoken to in a year(s). A few of them was the typical “communication just slows down until it stops entirely” type thing. Another friend actually reached out to me repeatedly last summer, and I was in a deep deep depression and never responded (I did eventually get treatment and feel much better about life). Another friend was around for an extremely embarrassing incident for myself, and afterwards I was so ashamed I never really reached out and those weeks turned into years at this point.

I’ve lately been feeling guilty for sort of...letting these friendships die, so I was wondering if anyone had ideas for a socially awkward fellow like myself...initiating conversation again...",2
"What are you doing lately to combat depression or anxiety? For me personally, I've limited reading a ton of negative or scary articles. I'm barely on internet anymore and *gasp* even reddit. I feel my mental health had improved. Curious what other people are doing and tips to continue feeling hope that life will return to normal. No one is working in my home and I'm terrified of losing the house, so that doesn't help.",2
"A friend commented earlier today on how happy I look today; and now I can't stop smiling whenever I remember it. It's been a rough last year. My previous work brought be so much anxiety (too much OT and weekend works) and dealing with a lost of a love one can be taxing. As a result, I was suffering from insomnia last year. There was no sleep schedule; lifestyle is so sedentary and I wasn't eating as much.

I finally landed into my dream career this month. Been more accepting of myself. Slowly increasing the number of hours I sleep an average per week. Been socializing with enough time to my peers.

I am achieving my pursuit to happiness. I can finally admit I'm starting to conquer depression. I wish more happiness to all of you too.",2
"Today my dad asked me if I'd be interested in taking singing lessons with him and I wanted to tell someone My dad (60) and I (25F) live together, I moved back home due to COVID and have been enjoying this past while with him. 

He's always been a quiet and practical man, people say to me ""oh your dad is lovely..but he's very quiet isn't he"". Mum began to drink heavily and they both went into a depression. Dad completely closed himself off from everyone and would get angry at the smallest things, which is not his natural nature. They divorced and it was difficult, it's been a while now and I'm starting to see that my dad is becoming happier. Mum is slowly getting there too. 

So when he asked me to start singing lessons with him, it completely took me by surprise. It was a beautiful moment and I'm looking forward to it so much.",2
"So I think reddit cured my depression... I was depressed to the point which I didn't want to leave my room and I always had to throw a fake smile, till I found reddit as a great way to not only pass time but to have a true smile, I wondered around for a while checking all the sub-reddits for things I like and found new people to talk to. Probably the best choice I've made in my life. I've been talking to alot of people and even socialising with my friends again tellimg them about the things I find that made me happy. Thanks to all on this site for making me a better person and realizing there is happiness and life is what I make it.",2
I made my bed this morning for the first time in years!! I’ve been battling depression for a long time now. I’m always used to just climbing back into bed several times a day with the sheets all messy. Finally making some slow progress!!,2
"Fellow redditors, what does your social life look like these days? Obviously covid has fucked a lot of it up but I’m curious what it looks like these days? 

I’m going through a depression and I think a lot of it may have to do with feeling like I’m not getting enough interactions with people. Even those seemingly meaningless interactions with people at the gym or at the store are either gone or a lot less frequent. On top of that, the ways I used to meet people before are almost nonexistent. I wish I could go to a restaurant on a weekday or hit the bar on the weekend.",2
"I leave my sister anonymous feedback on YOLO (an annon Q&A app through Snapchat) to help her while she’s facing depression My younger sister is my favorite person in the whole world, but lately we have been kind of distant from me moving out of the house. I noticed she has become increasingly depressed, and there’s only so much I can do. So, she posts these YOLO questions and I respond pretending to be someone from her school saying she’s pretty/they miss her/etc. (and I give my own real response!) Hopefully this will boost her confidence. I love her, and she’s so great, I hope that I can make her happy even tho I’m far away :)

Let me know what y’all think. Have you done anything similar? Tell me your stories!",2
"Do not know how to of something at all Spring is always a kinda depression period of time to me. I don't know what I'm doing and why, I always contemplating decisions I've made, and so on. Also I'm going to enter a college this year so I'm not sure whether everything I've done and continue to do for this process is value or even appropriate at all.
Moreover I have a lot of problems and rough period in my family. And my best friend have much more harder period of time right now. I know and feel that she needs my support so I'm trying to give it to her (and it's also the thing that I want to do for her as well).

So for me everything is as complicated and tangled that I don't know what to do and where to start. What is more, if I try to hang out or do 'nothing' I always have this feeling that I need to go and do something.

So right now I wanna scream and cry at the same time 🤣🤣

P.S. sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native English speaker::)",2

"As someone with PTSD and severe depression, I really appreciate the mind-numbing properties of Skyrim. I love the repetition, the washed out colors, the music, the somewhat bland yet still adventurous landscape. I've placed at least 1,000 hours into this game, and for good reason - it's my calm space.",2
"Movies vs life I [48M] (single, married twice. Have had depression since my teens) was just listening to a Bee Gees song while driving.  As the chorus swelled, it reminded me of when that sort of song is used at the turning point of a movie.  Things are starting to turn around for the protagonist, and she or he starts on the path to completeness and happiness.  I remember years ago when that sort of movie made me feel so good about life.  Today it made me cry, thinking back to the hopes that I had back then.   It makes me wonder if someone that is very positive and motivated, would see that sort of movie, and it may actually give them inspiration to act.  Like give them ideas that they actually act on in the near future.  Rather than just (like me) snuggling up with their warm and fuzzy feelings and doing nothing",2
"As a talentless person, I'm extremely grateful for all the gifted musicians I had for neighbours! For as long as I can remember, I always had some musical genius living next door. 

Even indoors! Even as a small child my mom had a piano prodigy for a roommate! All my life I've had a neighbor who played an instrument and I could hear it. Piano, guitar, cello, piano, guitar... (Never had a drummer tho, I can't wait!)

I think I only lived near musicians and/or very gifted people. 
I always immensely enjoyed hearing them play.
It would never even cross my mind to complain about ""noise""...

Whenever they would just pick up their instrument and play their heart out, it always made me so happy.

At times it would scrape me off the floor and help so much with my depression.
I wish I left a note to say how much I appreciated their music.

For what it's worth - thank you, you lovely, gifted musicians, you made my life so much better!",2
"Amidst a bad depression, I did something important today I’ve been in a deep spell of depression and as a part of it I have avoided opening my mail because I don’t want to deal with all the bills I have. I have been worried for days about the idea of my utilities being shut off because I haven’t paid and I owe a lot.

Today I went through my utility bills and found out that things are manageable and nothing is in danger of being shut off. Really relieves a lot of stress for the moment.",2
"getting better after a bad depression slump as you must know, Ramadan recently started and i decided to make myself better as this month is supposed to be very rewarding. i was in a really bad depression slump and ngl it was difficult to come out of it.

2. bathed after three days!!!
3. made some very tasty biryani :)
4. prayed and read the Quran
5. did ALL of my laundry!!!!

I've been struggling with a bout of depression lately and it's been so difficult to do more than the bare minimum of waking up, maybe eating a meal, and barely scraping by with my job (working from home). My sleep schedule got wrecked and I started sleeping 14+ hours a day. School started 2 weeks ago and I have not been able to bring myself to get any of my work done, but today.... Today I finally mustered up the energy to knock out one of my projects for school. On top of that I actually cleaned the huge mountain of dishes that have piled up. I finally have clean bowls! Idk, I know these are very small things that most people do every day but it feels like such an accomplishment to actually get something done today and I just needed to share it somewhere.",2

"I need your help with my depressed teenage daughter. My 15 yo daughter is really struggling with depression. She has no motivation, is constantly tired and finds no pleasure in all the things she loved to do. Depression runs in our family too so the symptoms are highly recognizable. I know she would feel better if she had a sleep schedule, if she got outdoors for a walk, if she bathed or tidied her room. She has seen doctors over the last year but is not connecting with any of them coz, ya know, covid. I don’t know if I am making things worse by trying to motivate her.

I hate it when people fake having depression only for attention. It's not fair for the people who have actually been diagnosed. You can NOT self-diagnose with depression, only a psychiatrist, professional, or therapist can! Depression isn't a puberty phase, and it's also not just being sad, or feeling hopeless. It is a serious mental illness!",1

Depression is a mental illness that requires diagnose from a professional. Not a buzzfeed quiz, not being sad. There is a huge difference between being sad and being depressed. If you have a lot of the symptoms, it may be likely you have depression. But depression requires diagnose. You can not self diagnose this. If you have a lot of the symptoms please go see a doctor, but never self diagnose. This goes for many other mental illnesses too. If you think you have something, look up if it requires diagnose. If it does, go see a doctor and find out.",1

To those who want specific songs, I suggest “Truce” on Vessel; “Friend, Please” on the first self-titled album and “Leave The City” on Trench.

"I hate being alive. I’m tired of being strong & not getting the support I need. My mum stresses me out & makes me feel like us kids are the reason her life has gone 2 shit. I have anxiety & depression thanks 2 previous experiences like extreme bullying, sexual assault & my parents divorce. Help me😭 ",2
"I tell my fiancé my depression is getting better because I don’t want to be a burden. I love them very much and just want them to be happy. I can tell how much it drains them to deal with my issues, so I generally just keep quiet about it. I often have really bad days when I want to self harm and die but I just ignore it till I fall asleep and continue like nothing happened. I feel bad opening up to them about it because I don’t want to stress them out or make them worry.",2
I use alt accounts to mask how often I post to depression subreddits [Light] Kinda pathetic huh,2
"I’m afraid of getting rid of my depression cause then I won’t have anything to blame for my failures Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect all the kind words. I was afraid something like this would have been viewed as spineless. Thank you all for the understanding and support! My heart goes out to anyone else suffering from depression. Hang in there, lads. ",2
"I was super smart, got a concussion, now i'm dumb and have depression, but now I have super fast reflexes, and am not socially awkward I was super smart as a 13-14 year old, geographic genius, knowing all countries as well as most of their capitals. Now, I had a hard time spelling concussion, I'm not socially awkward anymore, I'm not a A student, and I can't bear the fact that I was once so smart and now I'm so dumb. I can't learn new math anymore, and I'm getting depressed again. I got this concussion playing football, in practice some kid hit me in the facemask with the top of his helmet and I didn't get knocked out, I just felt groggy and dull. 

TDLR I'm depressed because of my concussion making me dumb",2
"I am a depressed socially awkward idiotic alcoholic, who when drunk transforms into an even more intolerable personality. Most of my days are spent smoking up, crying for nothing and just loathing about how pathetic my life is. It has occurred to me that in my highly active college community, every time I drink, I end up making many enemies, specifically because of me getting a bit too handsy with women.I badly regret being one huge animated pile of shit and this just worsens my depression and pushes me deeper into alcohol. I just am a terrible human being.",2
"I stole phone minutes and then there was a plastic bag situation 1. Many years ago when I first arrived in Iraq, I didn’t have a phone card to call home, so a LT let me use his card. The card would automatically refill with minutes, so instead of buying my own card I continued using his minutes, thinking he wouldn’t notice. I got caught and had to pay him back 

2. Once when my ex was sleeping, for whatever reason I thought it would be funny to put a plastic bag over his head. He woke up & I sorta joked about it like it was nothing 

3. I swallowed a bottle of my depression meds, but threw them up because the thought it was for attention crossed my mind. Not that suicide isn’t serious because it is, but my reason for wanting to do it was for the wrong reason. I enjoy life now! It got better!!",2
"I drink myself into a coma when my depression hits the hardest... I don’t like alcohol honestly. If it doesn’t taste sweet i won’t like it. I’m the biggest dweeb when it comes to taking shots. I’ll gag at just about anything straight from the bottle. But one thing that makes me forget the taste is my depression. I’ve suffered from depression for years. It wasn’t until earlier this month that i was convinced to see a therapist. But before that, i would try to drink my pain away. I don’t know if this labels me as an alcoholic. I only drink when i feel depressed. It’s not often but i know it isn’t healthy for me at all. It just sucks that it’s always the things that can damage you that seem to take away the pain temporarily. But i am seeking professional help y’all. Sigh* hoping for that progress",2
"I tell people that i dont drink but i drink away my depression nearly everyday I dont want to annoy them with my problems, so thats my only help at the moment. Also im drunk right now, so yeah thats the only time when i actually have balls.",2
"One of the most depression things is watching your favorite sport that you use to excel in and knowing you will never be at that level because of certain factors or limitations. I used to play soccer I’m really good at it still , I’m almost 18 and have not played in about 2 years almost 3 now. I could play any position and was a well round player, would get MVP and all types of awards.I stopped because of certain limitations such as money to play for higher clubs and transportation. Just eats at you knowing you can’t or won’t play professionally.",2
"I have lost almost 70 lbs in the past year thanks to my depression, alcoholism and drug use. And all the compliments on “how great” I look is making it so hard to stop my bad and addictive habits. I know I need to get help but I can’t. I don’t want to go back to being fat. My life is pretty sad now but my life before was just as miserable and worse because I was so fat. At least now I get attention from guys and I’m not looked at as just the “cute fat friend”  anymore.  ",2
"Middle class kid has fake depression It's exactly like everyone thinks. My life is so damn easy that I create my own problems so that one day I can say that I went through a hard time. I really hope that I'll be humble enough to accept that I had money and a good support system one day, but for now I'm just a 15 year old kid circle jerking to depression with her equally well off friends.",1
"Depression keeps getting worse and scared to either talk to someone or take meds As the title says, ever since February my depression is slowly getting worse and worse. It's mainly family problems I can't control right now and a family member who has made it horrible. Honestly there's been many times this year I've thought of ending everything and making lives better but someone special in my life has been helping me feel better even if he thinks he doesn't. I want to get on meds to help me stop feeling like shit everyday but I'm scared how I'll react to the meds and how I will be after I get on them. I also fear talking to someone thinking their advice would just be scripted and mean nothing ",2
"I’m using my depression to help me lose weight by letting it beat me down and feeling guilty for wanting food. I just let the voice that tells me I’m worthless tell me I’m worthless and don’t deserve to eat anything and that I’m fat already. I’ve been really into intermittent fasting and I’ve frequently gone more than 36 hours straight without food. I often don’t eat more than 1000-1200 calories a day. I’ve already lost some weight. I feel less bad about my body at least but I feel like I’m in a deeper, darker hole.",2
My gf addresses my bouts of depression as Emo shit. That's pretty much it. For some reason everyone seems inaccessible now. Idk if I'm using this sub-reddit properly but I feel this is something that I can't share with anyone else but need to get off my chest. ,2
"My wife is bipolar with depression, anxiety, and OCD. I don't know how much longer I can help her. She is on medication for all of it. Plus more to help her sleep. I'm trying my hardest and have for about a year and a half. The mood swings are the hardest. The anxiety makes it unbearable to have a ""normal"" moment with. The OCD gives her bad thoughts. The depression stopped our social lives.",2
"[Remorse] I use memes to hide my depression Most of my family and friends don't care that I contemplate suicide everyday, and just think I'm being dramatic. The first time I saw a suicide meme, I thought it was kinda funny and relatable. It took me 3 years to realize that I liked those memes because they reminded me of my depression in an ironic way.",2
Everybody around me is depressed and they all act like they’re the only ones. Fuck that. Growing up into adulthood I learned to manage my depression so it affects me and my environment as little as possible. I moved a lot but found a more permanent place around 3 years ago. All my new friends are depressed. Some of them are managing it too and not trying to get pity points. I’m trying to help the other ones who cry for help but don’t want to help themselves. I’ve tried to offer them as much support as possible. Yet always they would rather waddle in their thoughts and be extremely selfish. I get it. You’re depressed. So am I. So is everyone. I can’t do the work for you. Sorry. I’m not going to let people bring me down just to be dismissed. I just can’t stand their selfishness.,2
I call out from work on days my depression really flares up I live with my mom and I just tell her that they told me not to come in. She knows about my depression but if I told her the truth she would be furious and possibly kick me out. I feel so bad but I know going in there with that attitude would not end well for me. ,2
"I am convinced depression is not a real thing and I lose respect for everyone who claims to have it It’s a millenial meme, nothing more. It’s just privileged teenagers trying to be trendy/quirky, or who are just bored and think it’s depression.",2
"It feels like I’ve had two lives: one before the depression, and now I remember the exact weekend my life changed forever. I went up north for a vacation and in the span of an hour my great grandpa died and this girl I really liked ended things with me for good. After that, the depression beat me. 

Before all that happened I was a relatively happy guy, I was insecure but it was just in my head. I had it made. I was fit, active, had a bright future, and had the girl too. 

Now, I’m slightly overweight, conscious of every aspect about myself, and lonelier than ever. My insecurities aren’t just in my head anymore they’re real life. I don’t do anything but play video games and smoke. I don’t have the drive to, and when I try to it’s always short lived. My future isn’t too bleak, I could live what most would consider to be a good life. It’s the depression staring me in the face that makes it all so dark. 

I don’t know how to fix this. I’m scared to reach out. 

",2
I've come to peace with the fact that I'll always have depression. I don't remember who I was before it. I don't know who I would be without it. I've done a lot and little has changed. I've just been numbed between all the pain and medication cocktails. My forearms will always look like washed out barcodes. I feel like I'm looking at life through a dirty window pane while its trudging by and I couldn't care less. I'm objectively less happy than most people and I'm okay with it at this point. As long as I contribute to the world around me in some way and don't harm others I can live with this.,2
I get uncomfortably depressed after finishing TV shows Like hot damn It feels like a friend died or something after I finish pretty much any show I really like I just get hit with some crazy depression. I think I just miss the feeling of being excited about somthing other then work ,2
"I’m sick to death of hearing about people with depression and anxiety I swear every second person I speak to has depression or anxiety or maybe even a combo of both. 
And to point out your mental illness first time speaking to someone like it’s a fucking trophy or something 

Seriously.

Suck it up!",1
"Depression Okay so I have been dealing with depression since about 2007. I didn't know this at the time and didn't find out it was depression until about 4 or 5 years ago. I have attempted suicide 3 times in recent years. I have been to around a dozen psychiatric hospitals. I still feel suicidal nothing so strong that I would act on it most of the time. But I feel like I would be okay with dying. It would be a good thing, selfish but good. I have meds that I'm supposed to take and I want to take them I just don't. I don't do much of anything good for myself. I don't take care of my cleanliness or anything. I want to I just don't. Let me know if you would like to read a much larger story of some of my life issues and stuff and I will post it. I'm just not good at summarizing and I really want help but I didn't think anybody would want to read a huge story. Thank you.",2
"I have no motivation for school anymore, due to depression, and the fact that school doesn't get you anywhere anymore. Pretty much the title. I am 16 years old, and i have ditched class about 140 times this whole year. Sometimes, i don't wish to go. Most of the time, i am crazy depressed and depression just sucks the soul out of me. My parents give me flak for it, (Rightfully So) but it won't solve the problem, and i feel alone. 

On top of that, i have no plans be going to post secondary as well. A college degree doesn't get you anywhere anymore, and a HS diploma is nearly worthless. 

Right now, i am going to save up cash from my current job, and open a computer shop. It's something i have passion for, and a goal that drives me. Plus, i have that skill, and i once worked at one.",2
"I'm only in vet tech because i played chicken with depression. A few years ago, I was miserable and working in a factory.  It's probably one of the 2nd or 3rd lowest points in my life.  I was listening to music, since I was lucky enough to be allowed to, and working my factory job.  Something in me broke.  I said to myself: ""One week.  You have one week to get your shit together.  If you don't, end your life.""  I had fully accepted death as an option, and was at peace with both possibilities.  I had a plan, I'd slip out one night and kill myself with a knife.

Before the week was up, I decided I will pursue veterinary medicine in some form.  Hell or highwater.  I'm now halfway through the local vet tech program.  I played chicken with depression and won.",2
"I lied when I took a depression test so my parents don't feel guilty. I'm certain that I have crippling depression, a day ago, I filled out a questionnaire handed to me by my doctor, and I could relate to every category **severely** but I lied. Long story short, I lied when filling out the questions because I don't want my parents to feel like failures.",2
I’ve been using Marijuana for over 5 years now after I witnessed a horrific car accident and then depression. My family is incredibly anti-drug and they have no idea. I have to smoke in secret and alway have plans in place so they won’t find out. ,2
"I got drunk off my aunt and uncles booze as a teenager as a child, I struggled with depression and self-harming starting at age 10 at age 14 I attempted suicide and was hospitalized more than once when I was released a second time I went to visit my ant in another state for a bit over a month when I was having depressive episodes I would go to my uncles' liquor cabinet and take shots of vodka drink tequila to sip the rum, etc I would get drunk and drink brush my teeth drink a glass of milk then take a nap or watch tv it was nice to numb myself and I never got caught but I regretted it when I went home cause I didn't know how to cope without cutting burning myself or getting drunk so it took me longer than it should have to start using healthy coping skills I always felt guilty for drinking my uncles Booz but at the moment I was overwhelmed and never cared",2
"I lied to my doctor about depression. So at my annual checkup my doctor gave me a form which asks a bunch of questions like do you ever feel hopeless, do you think about suicide, all that kinda stuff. I checked all the boxes for no I do not feel these things for all of these, however I pretty regularly do. 

I’m not really sure why I lied. I guess I don’t want to think that something is wrong with me. The worst part for me is though that I don’t know if I do have a problem or if it’s just a phase that will pass in a week or two. It scares me to think that I might be making too big of a deal out of a small issue that I should just be able to deal with on my own. 

I’m not asking for you guy’s advice on this though, I just wanted to get this off my chest as it’s been weighing down on me for a couple months now. ",2
"The source of my depression this past 3 years M/20 
I haven’t got my licence. 
I’ve tried 2 to do the test already and am overcome with the ideal I’ll never be able to pass. 
People give me all these weird looks when They find out or tell them I only got my Ls. 

What a relief and what a nightmare to know what it is that causes me so much stress!!! Feel like self harm when I think about it",2
"I faked a depression because I got behind in school My 6th semester has been extremely tough. Assignment after assignment while also having more lectures than ever have really taken its toll on me. I was exhausted and scared of not passing, I needed more time. Luckily everyone has a depression nowadays so after 30 minutes at the Doc, I was free to ""recover"" untill I was well. Now I'm on my 6th month out of school, studied what I needed and up to date with everything I'll meet again at this semester. I'm ready to start my 6th semester over again. Oh and since I'm Scandinavian I'm getting around $1000 a month while studying.",1
"Pretty sure my anxiety and depression just made me end my relationship I was with her for 7 months and we had just said I love you. I’ve never been good with emotions so I think I panicked and now I broke it off last night because I thought she’d be better off with someone who can feel the same way she can. And everything can “flow” better for her instead of being with me. She was my first GF I’m M18. Something just kept telling me she wasn’t the one and we didn’t deserve her. But how could she not be the one we were so good together, I don’t understand but maybe one day I will. 

That’s all I think thanks",2
"I created a new account to be able to talk about my depression I created a new account so that i would be able to talk openly about my depression and suicidal thoughts without the fear of being judged by people in my life. 

I find it extremely hard to share with friends and loved ones how I'm feeling exactly. My only way of sharing my true feelings about anything is through writing, because it's easier to hide within my words. 

I know my life would be somehow easier if I went to a shrink, but I'm always worried that they might judge me one way or another.

"I hate depression I wish I felt like I could actually tell someone how depressed I really am. And I hate that I am depressed because everything is supposed to be great. I’m in a happy relationship, have a great family, and great job. So then why do I still feel so damn alone and worthless all the time?",2
"To fight my depression and anxiety I didn't leave my room since Friday night till Monday morning except to go to the fridge or bathroom. 

[No regrets]",2
"I reach out to people on r/depression because it helps me I like reaching put to those who are feeling hopeless but I partly do it for selfish reasons. I've had years and years of issues with being depressed so when I'm doing good I like to help out others. When I'm down it gives me other people to reach out to and I can reflect on things I've told others. Mostly, it's hard to feel worthless if you've genuinely helped others. I wish I was truly being more selfless but as long as it helps I'll keep doing it.",2
"[Remorse] I have bad hygiene because of years of depression and it makes me feel pathetic. I'm finally getting better after nearly 10 years of being depressed and having undiagnosed Bipolar 2. However, I can seem to break habits of depression like not showering and not brushing my teeth.

I try really hard to remember to do this things, I have a daily checklist and everything, but I've been neglecting my hygiene for so long that it's become a habit.

It's hard to feel better about yourself when you don't take care of yourself and think you're gross. I feel pathetic because I can do things normal people do without trying really hard...

If anyone has been through something similar I'd appreciate advice.",2
"I smoke weed to help me cope with my problems and depression I have to do it in secret to make sure my family doesn’t know, but smoking lessens my anxiety a lot and let’s me not think about shitty things that’s on my head ",2

"I failed a class for the first time. My depression is back. Today I failed my first class in college. I am a sophomore and an international student and I had a 3.75 GPA.  

I just failed and art class, this class is not related to my majors (Computer Science and Business Management). I had an 88&#37; before the final, and after taking the final it dropped to 59&#37;. 

I feel so fucking bad, last 2 years were great for me because I 'beat' depression but right now I want to fucking kill myself. I dont know what to do. This fucking F will be in my transcript my whole life. I AM A FUCKING PIECE OF GARBAGE. 

I dont really know what to do, some people told me: 'its just a class, retake it' but is not as easy at it seems, i fucking screwed my future because of a fucking class that is not related to the shit I want to do.

"I became alcoholic before the legal age due to depression So I wanna confess this to my family that I became a drinker in early age and yeah they don't know about it. This all started when I joined my new part time job as a content writer for a TV show website. My bosses are pretty frank and employees are very comfortable with them. 

Because of some shit I'm going through, I got emotionally depressed due to my office situations. And to handle these extreme stress conditions I started drinking. Believe me, it helped me alot to handle my emotions. And after a bottle down I really feel better. Currently, I'm feeling great but still not sober.",2

"My Depression medicine kept me from keeping an erection during my first time Reposted due to improper flair

I have had a pretty serious girlfriend for the past month or so, and we finally came to the agreement that we were ready to move things to the next level. I take depression medication that causes libido issues but I thought it wouldn’t be an issue. Things were getting heated and we were massaging each other but as she reached into my pants I lost my erection. We just kinda shrugged it off  and she has been really supportive of me but I’m just so embarrassed. I’m going to stop taking my medication and my girlfriend doesn’t really want me to, but I just feel so inadequate.

"Sometimes I purposefully avoid going to lunch with my best friend because he has severe depression. [Conflicted] I do everything I can to cheer him up on a day to day basis. I know that just being there cheers him up a little, but I know it's not that simple. He gets sad at random times, I don't blame him for it or anything, but sometimes when he's sad around lunch time I just won't go out to eat because I can't bare the painfully awkward walk in silence to a shop and back. I feel terrible about this because it probably makes me a horrible human being, but I only have one good friend at college, him. So spending every college day with him can be a real drag on my mood which on exacerbates his mood.",2
"My depression makes my boyfriend depressed. Idk if this is really a confession, more of an asking for help post. 
Before we were dating he was always happy. Since he’s been with me, he’s gotten gradually depressed, I’m guessing because I get depressed a lot cause I overthink and make myself sad. It’s nothing too bad, I’m just a deep thinker and I just wonder a lot. I do have anxiety though. He told me when I have problems it makes him feel hopeless and depressed. How can I fix this? I almost wanna resort to not telling him any of my problems just cause I don’t want him feeling sad too. ",2
I feel like a bitch for being depressed about not getting a text back Keeping it brief. Made friends with girl. Said we would text and hang out as friends over summer. Haven't talked in 2 weeks.

I have depression and I’ve had it for years. Usually around this time of the year I get really bad seasonal depression. I am usually my lowest. I have been showing symptoms of my seasonal depression, but i haven’t fallen into my usual slump...

This job pays really well and I don’t think another opportunity like this will come along, but I usually start to hate it after 4 months. 
I’m worried that I’m going to have a break down, because I seem to be doing oddly well. I know it’s because I’m going to the gym and doing yoga and eating better, but I’ve always done that before and it never helped. I’m worried I’m going to spiral because life seems to be quite calm...",2

I do believe depression is a real issue and can really mess people up. I also do believe that I suffer to a degree from depression, maybe not as bad as other's, where people can't function day to day, they have really dark thoughts, etc, etc.

But sometimes when I need a pick me up and to realize that, hey, there's some real positives in my life and that I'm not too far beyond a point where I can't better my life. I'll hope over there and read some posts. ",2

"I'm a Junior in high school and my bad GPA and pressure to get into a good college is making me more and more depressed. I struggled with depression for years up until a few months ago, and at that point my gpa was already destroyed. It got as bad as a 2.6 last semester. This semester I felt better overall in life and was really motivated and didn't spend all my time in my room alone, so I got a 3.9 \(weighted\) and a 1410 on the may SAT. It's not enough and I still have a 2.95 cumulative gpa. All I can do nowadays is worry about college because I know I won't be able to get into a school that I want. I really want to go to James Madison University or Virginia Tech, but I know I can't. I want to be a successful Computer Science major at one of those schools, but I know I won't have the chance.

I got everything I wanted. Been waiting my life for this. I still have depression. It really doesn’t just go away. I knew that already but it proved it to me.

All of them moved and went to college and did shit with their lives. I wasn't so lucky. I didn't come from a privileged family. Anything I ever got in life I earned for myself. I have a decent job paying $14.50 an hour. I have my own place. I try and make myself happy with things and that doesn't seem to work. I tried making more friends. People I actually fit in with. But now it just seems like they use me as a drug plug. Only coming over to get something and only staying like 30 min to an hour. I feel like the older I get the more unhappy I'll be. 
Idk. Feels good to let it all out. Sorry for the long post.",2
"I'm afraid of being diagnosed with depression because I feel people will stop taking me seriously. I'm scared everyone will blame every single negative emotion I have on a chemical imbalance and everything I'm going through won't be real anymore.

I know I need help. I've been feeling this way since I was a kid and I've tried to kill myself twice. It's really only a matter of time and lost hope.

But I feel like getting help will invalidate me.

I guess my pride is getting in the way.

Most of all, i am crying every night and thinking of how to die and i fall asleep that way. I really love my family but they're the ones that hurt me the most like they did before. I know its too much to ask them to be dead so its better if I'm the one dead

Playing my suicide is always in my mind now and I am not happy, I only go through the day just in case i do come up with a good location and way to die. I wish i was dead.",2

"The reason why some people treated with anti-depressants commit suicide. My Neurology attending sometimes blurred the lines between fact and his philosophy. For this one, I'm not too sure:

He said the reason that some people with depression commit suicide after being treated with anti depressants is that they suddenly come to the realization that they have wasted years of their life being depressed, hurt loved ones close to them in the process, and generally feel heavy guilt for living with depression for so long and this leads them to suicide. I couldn't find any literature on it, but it sounds like a plausible theory.

So is this the general consensus on post-treatment suicide in MDD patients, or is this just his theory?",1

In an (obligatory) hypothetical scenario, one of my close friends is an incoming med student and is kinda going through a rough time these past few weeks (depression, anxiety). They’re functional, can hide it well, and have no thoughts about hurting themselves. It’s more about addressing the emotional distress, rather than dealing with a more severe issue. 

They’ve read the PHP horror stories and are genuinely concerned about how seeing a therapist/psychiatrist and starting meds might affect their licensing/career. Posts like this have been answered in the past, and “get help” was almost unanimous response. She’s more so looking for suggestions on how to protect her future career. 

Would it be safe to go through her school’s counseling center or to go through her insurance? Would it just be better to pay in cash and use a fake name? In other words, what should they do to protect themselves?",2

"Depression, Anxiety and Bipolar? Hi

I have depression on and off all my life, I have significant issues with anxiety and in the last year, I have been taking Mirtazapine 45mg, and lamotrigine 100mg, and I feel mentally good and more stable.

Before I started this combination of meds, I was very emotional, found it difficult to control anger, and at times hypersexual. This has been moderated but I still find myself doing crazy shit. Things I know I shouldn't do, but I can't seem to help myself. I get really fixated on a topic and can't drop it, even when I know it is bad for me.

I have not had a bipolar diagnosis and only see a general practitioner for treating my mental health.

Also, I find the current regimen of meds has kills my libido and erections.

Am I bipolar?  Should I change me meds? Do I need better help?

Would it be okay to reduce my meds and see if my sex life can resume?

I am interested in other opinions.

Sometimes he is in an episode and will go... And there doesn't seem to be any improvement at all afterward. Sometimes it's like he's in even more of a depressed mood. 

Today he said he's going to his ""useless therapy"" appointment"" and when I ask why he thinks it's useless he said ""I think he's running out of ideas."" 

I'm trying to be supportive and not jump to conclusions. Maybe people just go through stretches where their therapy isn't really doing much... But it also seems like he's convincing himself and talking himself into the fact, that it's useless.

Looking back, those depression ""episodes"" have manifested into one long continuous period of time, mainly off and on through University and such. 

As I have been reflecting back on the last couple of years, I feel that my memory is foggy. It's all one big blur, with only a handful of experiences standing out prominently. I have trouble remembering lots of events from just three to four years ago.

Is this a result of my depression? Does depression really fog up memory? And if so, is it possible for those memories to come back prominently? I am in a bit of a depressive mood as of recently, so maybe that has something to do with it. Would just like some answers :)",2

I’ve been having some crazy dreams lately and, it’s made me anxious whilst dreaming and then, incredibly depressed once I wake up. For example, last night I had a dream that I was dating a girl that looked just like Margot Robbie (my celebrity crush), I had a good job and a good group of friends. I woke up and I felt so depressed because these are the things I don’t have and I feel like I never will. Sometimes I want to live in my dreams forever because that’s where I feel at my happiest. 

I don’t know what to do, any advice?",2

Could it be true that we have people online who’re trying to brainwash and produce more harm then good?",1
What are your takes on the recent influx of self-diagnosed conditions like anxiety and depression? I'll leave my own thoughts out of it to avoid skewing anything. Just curious what others think.,2

"Depression problem (This is for a friend, so there may be some things that are vague.)  


my best friend is going through huge wave of depression, they've been dealing with lots of family problems for years and they havent been able to get help at all. Their family percieves their depression as a joke. I've helped them most of the time with a couple others but it isnt working. They've been cutting themself and have no idea what to do next. They're ready to kick the bucket but are too scared to do it. everything that would make them happy has been stripped from them, their bike, electronics, games, etc. If i respond to any comments it will be either my friend or me. they really need help and I've lost strategies to do so.  


Note: they arent able to call any help centers or go to them due to their phone not having a plan. their home phone is a no-go because their family can listen in using multiple other phones the house has.",2
"How do I stop myself from falling into a depression? I have no idea why, but I just have not had motivation for the past few days. I have just been sitting around wasting time and I hate myself for it. Last week I was extremely happy, working on projects of mine and being able to get work done. But now I just feel so overwhelmed that I think i'm falling into a depression. Is there a way to combat this or do I just have to let it overtake me?
Thanks.",2

"Does having depression or anxiety as a teen increase the chances of having it again as a adult? I am just wondering if it does. I possibility experienced both (not at the same time just in separate time frame. Depression was around 13-now (it has gotten a lot better) and anxiety when I was around 10-12.

Back then I didn’t know much about mental health. I just knew the general idea and what the media had shown so therefore I never suspected I possibility had anxiety until now. I realized back then I had a lot of symptoms of anxiety like lost of appetite, swallowing difficulties, a hell of physical symptoms, overthinking to the extent, etc. It slowly went away. I only ever had one anxiety attack it was in 6th grade and back then I didn’t know it was an anxiety attack",2

"Depression sucks I’ve had depression since I was 18 or so. I’m 51 now. I’ve been on Long Term Disability for nearly one year. I tried not to go off on sick leave but no matter how many times I spoke to the HR department (and/or my boss) I couldn’t get any help/support. Today I had a call from the insurance company to discuss my claim and see how I’m doing. Near the beginning of the call she asked if I’d been reading or watching any movies. I mentioned that I’d been reading a book series. Later in the call she says that she thinks I can go back to work because “if I’m able to read a book I’m able to go to work”. Well thank you insurance lady! Reading was one of my only pleasures. I’m not eating, I’m not showering, I’m not getting dressed. I barely make it out of bed. But because for 30 - 60 minutes a day I’m able to crack open a book it means I’m well enough to go back to my overwhelming job? Awesome.",2
How can I explain to my parents what depression feels like? All I want to be accepted and understood but it always seems like my home environment marinates me in that I’m different and I’m the bad example. My family calls me lazy and uninspiring but I can’t seem to express properly how it truly feels other than that I’m tired and most days I don’t want/can’t to get out of bed. I’m also just tired of my therapists saying that I need to kind of parent myself when it really feels like I can’t trust myself to give myself structure. I mean I’m glad that my family can give me a lot of materialistic things but I can never properly explain or actually convey that giving me materialistic things can replace the emotional needs I need,2

I started on the first of February and from that day i started exercising for two hours per day. 30 minutes running, 30 minutes weights, 30 minutes yoga, 30 minutes swimming. 

I'm glad that i actually started exercising because I had a lot of health issues in 2020. I had a heart-attack, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I have anxiety, depression, and taking medication for it.

But ever since I've been exercising a bit it's been helpful. I used to have thoughts of ending myself and losing hope, violent thoughts etc.

But I'm better now and I actually realize how beautiful life is.

So yeah, I have a relatively light day today (all on the comp), figured if anyone here, anyone at all wanted to know more about it or know the specifics, I'd be more then thrilled to answer any questions you may have.

"Mommy I’m high!!! When I was 3 years old I was Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. For those of you that don’t know much about diabetes you’re body can no longer control its blood sugar, so you have to do it manually using sugar (for lows) and insulin (for highs). Now that’s where it gets interesting! My mother has told me that many a time I would coming running up to her in a park, or shop, or a play date, or a ect yelling “MOMMY IM HIGH”. Now in my 3-8 year old brain this made total sense and there was no other possible meaning for being high. And my mother bless her heart just dealt with the side eyes and stares and didn’t explain it to me until I was old enough to understand what being high was in other contexts.

I got type one diabetes when I was 3 years old, I’ve been on an insulin pump for close to a decade as well.

I’m just super happy that I’ve made it this far without any issues!

How long have you had it for? 
How to do you inject your insulin? (Pump, needles or do you just take pills for it?)

This one is the hardest to determine since the number varies. Some say type 1 diabetes occurs in roughly 1 in 300 people, others say 1 in 6,500~ we'll go with the lowest of 1 in 300. Or 0.33% of the population

That means in the world 151,880,000 have red hair. Of that roughly 3,037,600 red heads also have pectus excavatum. Of those red heads with pectus excavatum roughly 10,024 of them also have type 1 diabetes. 
That's 0.00013% of the population
You have a 1 in 12,000 chance (0.083%) chance to be struck by lighting to put that into perspective so I guess I'm pretty rare.",2
"Ethics of Distribution of (potential) Covid Vaccines Given that there will be a limited supply in the early months (or even years) after a covid vaccine is approved, governments need to decide how to distribute them among the population. From what I have seen, at-risk population will be prioritised. Part of this group are people who are not elderly but have comorbidities like obesities and diabetes which are (a lot of times) lifestyle related ailments. 

Is distributing and administering a potential covid vaccine to non elderly at-risk population with preventable comorbidites essentially rewarding irresponsible behaviour?",1
"Skinsulin The other day I was telling my husband about how much smoother my skin felt since I had started using this sugar scrub. His response? ""Aren't you worried you'll get face diabetes?""

I would really like to make her something good that she can eat that she will like.

"First loss I work at a doctors office, often in the sick clinic swabbing for the plague. Basically- I’m exposed often. 

For over 7 months I have not had anyone in my personal life test positive. 

My SIL’s great aunt passed last week. She gave it to her son, who was 40- he passed. They gave it to her Grandma. An elderly, overweight woman with diabetes. Before she went to the hospital she told her daughter she wasn’t ready, she was scared, she didn’t want to go all by herself. 

I talked to my brother on Saturday and she was doing great! I talked to my brother yesterday, she was intubated. Last night she passed. Several  nurses were there for her and prayed. 

I know so many people have experienced this, but after all the positive people I’ve seen, it finally happened.

But here's the thing. Motivation comes and goes. Discipline is what people who are successful have. They force themselves to keep going, no matter what. That's what I need. Discipline.

And I did! With a combination of exercise and healthy eating, (goodbye BWW) I was able to lose 45 ish pounds in about a year. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like I lost as much as I did. Regardless, I am proud.

"Today my doctor gave me a high five Three months ago at my twice-yearly maintenance health visit, my doctor told me my blood sugar put me into Type II diabetes range. But because I’d lost about 12 lbs since I’d last been there, he was open to giving me three months to work on my A1C score. 

Today I went back. My blood pressure was good, my weight was down another five pounds, and my A1C was back in normal range. 

I’m very type-A, so having the information from him three months ago, and getting a glucose monitor to spot-check myself, I worked on figuring out what affected my blood sugar the most and then change my diet to address any problems. 

So today when he looked over my labs with me, he was super-impressed at what a major difference he saw between my August labs and my October labs. I was happy, so I was like, “yassss!” and he was like, “absolutely. This is impressive.” and my normally very reserved and staid GP gave me a spontaneous high five. 

This girl did good, y’all.",2
"So, the only death from COVID-19 so far in our State is in my hometown. Apparently, a 70-yr old man went into our local hospital and died shortly thereafter. The test for COVID-19 didn't come back positive until he was already gone. Right now I have to wonder, how long did he have it and who else was he around? If his family or friends didn't know...

We're a small rural town and up until now there haven't even been confirmed cases any closer than towns 40+ miles away. Some of our close family members have poor immune systems from diabetes and fighting cancer. NOW should I panic for real?

Ever since having children 4yrs. ago, my sister continues to gain weight and now weighs almost 200lbs., she’s about 5’. Whenever I would try to bring up the subject of weight loss, she usually ignores it and changes the subject. She has a big appetite during meals and would always sneak an unhealthy snack afterwards. Whenever I would tell her to lessen her intake of junk (usually sweets and chips), she would tell me that she seldom eats those. What she would always tell me is that the reason she can’t lose the weight is because she’s in her 30’s and her metabolism is slow, plus, she works a desk job that basically has her seated 8hrs/day. Luckily, her health is in good condition, but I’m worried since our family has a history of hypertension and diabetes.",2
"I got diagnosed with a genetic condition and couldn't be happier about it! For years I have been struggling with low energy and fatigue. Obviously I've been to doctors many times and have been tested for numerous things: viruses, diabetes, anemia, thyroid problems, adrenal dysfunction, etc. 

But now I finally have a concrete diagnosis: pyroluria! The best thing is it's totally treatable and, according to the expert I saw, is ""Life changing. Like updating from Windows 95 to Windows 7"". 

I'm really excited to have energy all of a sudden and finally start doing the things I've always wanted to do!

EDIT: Well, shit, you guys have convinced me to get a 2nd opinion. I've read a lot about Pyroluria and the *best* I can see is that the jury is out on whether it's legit or not. Will definitely be calling my specialist in the morning.",2
"I drink water constantly. Like I'm not even thirsty. I just like drinking water. I just a new plastic cup (one of those ones that looks like a fast food cup but it has a screw on lid and a hard plastic straw --- also it's got a Vault-Tec logo on it so karma?) and I can't stop drinking water out of this thing. Unlike normal plastic bottles I can have this one sitting right in front of me and use the straw. I've had to refill maybe 6 times since this morning and I'm about to go do it again.

I just love having something to drink and water is completely guilt-free.

"The satisfactional level of removing wound scabs is to high. I've gotten myself a wound on one of my feet that now has a scab on it. It's a really nice and crusty one that would be so awesome to remove. 

The problem is...

I've got silly diabetes (type 1) and wounds and damages on feet is nothing to play with when you have this condition since the infectional risk, on feet in particular, is higher. People have lost their feet due to bad infections...

But it would be so satisfying to remove it. But when a new scab forms I will probably want to remove that one too.

I'm going crazy over here...",2

Anyways, I've had diabetes for around a year and a half now and I'm so angry. I have gotten around the eating part, and now can eat whatever I want as long as I take insulin for it. But the way I get insulin is through an insulin pump. Its a small thing the size of an early iPhone that has tubing attached to it which is attached to a canula in my leg. However the stupid canula won't stay in my leg. Ive used every adhesive solution ever made to try to get it to stay but nothing works. I just finished mowing my lawn and my canula fell out. Which means I havent been getting insulin for either 5 minutes or an hour and a half. And I have no idea which one. This stupid disease sucks.

Then you move on. The result is already determined, it most likely won't change regardless of how much you wait. Plus being alone during valentine isn't the end of the world, everyone will be getting diabetes while you survive. 

In any case, I wish you good luck with your confession. It is scary to wait for the result, but what do you have to lose? This is what confession feels like: Perturbed, anxious, but nonetheless sincere and brave.

Hey there. I know that this post will only apply to some people, but I just felt I should post it. First, a bit of my story. I am a thirteen year old boy, turning fourteen this July. The thing is, I’ve spent 168 months on this planet. 153 of those I’ve had type 1 Diabetes. Fifteen months old. I don’t know what it’s like to be newly diagnosed, as I was to young, but I’m there for those of your who need it.

Don’t be afraid, diabetes is terrible, and I agree, but it could be worse. I don’t feel sad that I’m diabetic, instead I feel sad for those who have cancer, or are paralyzed, or some other terrible thing. Diabetes is bad, but it’s livable.

Don't get me wrong, diabetes isn't the end of the world and that's not the main reason I want to be gone by then, but I just think it'll be stressful. I hope I change by then though. Does anyone else think like this? Or is something really wrong with me?",2

"Therapeutic use of intermittent fasting for people with type 2 diabetes as an alternative to insulin (Case Report) [http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2018/bcr-2017-221854.full](http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2018/bcr-2017-221854.full)

Very interesting case report I came across this morning about the use of physician directed intermittent fasting. Of the patients (all three of whom had T2DM requiring insulin), all were able to discontinue insulin very shortly into the fasting period, and 2/3 stopped all OHAs entirely. 

Although recognising this is only a case series, this is a pretty incredible achievement. Is this something we should be encouraging more for motivated patients with T2DM?",1

"A thought about risk factors for poor outcomes in COVID-19 In China, their ICU teams found that patients who were older, had HTN, DM (presumably DM2), and CVD did very poorly (and cancer, but that’s easy to explain).  This raised a lot of speculation about the role of ACE2.

In Italy, reports were similar, but Italy is a western nation that looks more like the US than China.  They reported that the most common comorbidity was obesity.  They also reported severe glycemic disturbances with ketoacidosis.

And so this makes me think about this risk in a whole new light.  Hypertension and diabetes are hallmarks of the metabolic syndrome.  We know that the metabolic syndrome is a pro-inflammatory state.

And so my suspicion is that rather than something about ACE2, we are seeing a more fundamental dysregulation of the immune response.

I see multiple scenarios where a young healthy patient that have fasting glucose barely elevated like \~105, but their A1C is 5.5, 5.6. What should I tell them? Are they technically developing prediabetes but the A1C hasn't caught up to the fasting glucose yet?

"Hello everyone! New here! Feeling some intense cabin fever from the lockdown, and I've always been a person that likes meeting new people and finding something in common to chat about! Personally, I'm a big fan of coffee shops.  Mostly because I could sit in one, drink coffee by the gallon, and paint!  Like, easel-and-canvas type fine art portrait painting.  Man I miss the in-person social element of that!

Do you like painting or sculpture?  Who's your favorite artist?  \[Zero judgement from me, I like everything from Classical Greek to graffiti street art.  My personal favs include everything from Darick Robertson drawing the \*Transmetropolitan\* comic book, down to Rembrandt and Gainesborough.\]

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. He still has 7 more hours of surgery left. The doctors have not updated us about it either. It feels very heavy knowing that all I can do is send hope but I want to keep believing in that.

Edit: His operation ended sooner than we had estimated. He was awake and his eyes were open the moment he was being transferred out of the operation room but now we're just hoping he will remain stable in recovery. Thank you again for all the hope!

Edit: After the few days of him being stable, today he got a really bad fever and his blood pressure spiked up really high. The doctor said this might cause the brain to deteriorate and at worst shit down completely.",2
"Boss hung up on me this morning Yesterday I got my second shot and I was afraid of getting the symptoms and sure enough I did last night fever, chills, headache, then I call out this morning I was supposed to work at 9 and I called out at 6:30 am enough time. I call my supervisor and I tell him I got my second vaccine and I’m not feeling well and he goes your calling out and I said yes I’m not feeling well then he just hung up ... This whole morning I’ve been like wth why did he do that never had this experience before. I never call out either so I don’t know why I got that reaction. I’m pretty upset. Any thoughts on how I should handle this when I go back to work? Advice ? Similar stories ?",2
"First Covid Shot My wife and I both had our first shot yesterday at 10 AM. We are both in our 60s. At first all we had were sore injection sites. We went to bed feeling ok last night,but, this didn't last. I woke up at 3AM with fever, chills , dizziness and loopy balance.My wife hadn't stirred, so, I went into our unused bedroom/office. I got under a electric blanket and set it on high and this helped with the shakes after 15 minutes or so. I discovered that I felt a bit better sitting up,so, that's what I've been doing for several hours.I am hoping that this wears off as the day progresses.My wife is dragging around about like I am. We had this virus back in December and I feel like I did then. I don't think that my and my wife's experience is typical. My sister and brother-in-law who are both older than my wife and myself both had the Coronavirus 2 months ago and almost had no symptoms. Since then they have gotten the shot, both parts, and had no side effects.",2
"I found the solution for hay fever I've had seasonal hay fever for a long time, and my eyes and throat are really ichy during Spring.

It's been 2 days now, and my itchiness has greatly reduced! Also no more sneezes and loads of mucus.",2

My Nintendo 3ds is dead and my Nintendo switch has the drift issue in the left joycon. Really really bored and wish I had someone to talk to.

Hope ya'll doing ok, I have a boring weekend of staying inside and sleeping ahead of me, and then a good chance of no work for a few weeks after that.",2
"I finally realized one of my blankets was giving me fever dreams I have a few various comforters that I use on my bed, usually depending on what temperature is going on out there.  And among them, I got this massive down blanket for Christmas.  It's techncially the biggest of all the comforters, but it's very 'airy' and light.  Certainly was comfortable.

But I've finally put together a pattern of bad sleep and using that thing.  I would wake up in sweats and have sleep paralysis semi-frequently.  So I experimented with not using the thing at all, and have been fine ever since.

It's nuts, not even my weighted blanket came anywhere close to how that thing was cooking me in my sleep.  Too bad, I \*did\* actually like the thing.",2

Docs threw me on meds and made it worse for a while with shortness of breath, fatigue, breathing issues. I still have a slight cough, the COVID fog of memory issues, and fatigue, but I’m glad to be mostly out of the woods. Could have been a LOT worse!!",2

"Christmas time is the saddest time of the year For several years now, I’ve lost any excitement I used to have when Christmas was coming up. Not saying I’d be ecstatic like a kid eager for opening presents, but I wish I had some giddy anticipation like I used to. Maybe it’s cabin fever from being inside all the time. I missed going out at night when it snowed and seeing Christmas lights out with the classic songs playing. That’s my favorite type of atmosphere. But here I am, alone on Christmas without any friends to help celebrate the year together. I know this year has little to celebrate. But it’s nice to kick back and forget about the world for a brief moment when you’re in your own little place. Just wanted to mine dump. Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a happy holidays.",2
"Holidays make me want babies, ugh toddlers opening presents is my favorite freaking thing. I'm young, and definitely don't want any kiddos yet, but oh man are babies cute. I know all about the not cute moments but I really think me and my partner would be good parents. I seriously cannot wait to have a baby to buy presents for and snuggle and cook with.

Also anyone else with baby fever?",0
"I wish I was a kid again & could have just one more sick day home from school That was seriously the best. On a sick day Id get to stay home from school, so my parents would let me lay in their bed all day and watch cartoons. My mom would stop home on her lunch break to check in on me and make me soup and bring me ginger ale and then tuck me in before she left again. Staying home from work sick as an adult is awful. The whole time you’re stressed about the work you’re missing and if your boss is going to be mad at you or even fire you even if you’re throwing up with a fever and are also worried if you can even financially afford the day off. To be a kid again... it was like the only day where you’d just get to relax and be cared for and loved.",1

"I got into Dungeons and Dragons for the first time and it's AMAZING I've always been a fan of fantasy RP when I was younger, but due to the unpopularity of such things in my middle/high school (with it being too nerdy) and the lack of people I know IRL who are interested in it, I never got to experience it back then.

Lately with COVID and how the world is now, my friend on Discord was able to set up a campaign with the latest Frostmaiden expansion out and already being two games in so far I'm having an absolute blast. We just finished wrapping up our adventure today and just with how cooperative everyone's been and how much planning we all do it might start to throw a wrench in what our DM wants to do (in a good way).

"New-age Aquaman feels like a fever dream. Just watched the movie and to try and describe some of the things in it feels like a something you might hear from [Stefon on SNL weekend update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NctoAyRDtzU). 

I've seen some of DC's animated things like the Flashpoint Paradox and Aquaman/Atlantis is pretty much equally as fucking crazy, but it's just so much easier to not even stop to think about in animated form vs in the live action movie. 

I don't even think it's a bad thing either. The movie was fun and enjoyable.  ",0

"I've got a serious case of cabin fever I feel like I'm losing my mind right now lol.  I have been cooped up in my room for almost all of my spare time for the last... idk... few years probably?  And I'm getting real sick of it.

Here's the problem tho.  I don't have any friends and I don't know how to make them either.  My city is not super LGBT friendly so I'm not even gonna try to make friends around here.  I go to University in the nearest big city, but I live about a half hour away from there so it's really hard for me to make any sort of connections up there.

How do you even meet people to be friends with?  Like... do I just wander around the city and chat with random people?  IDK if I have some sort of social disorder but I feel like even meeting people and starting a conversation is impossible.

IDK I just feel lonely and want some friends man.  Thanks for reading my random ass rant lol.",2
"Does anyone else have a fever dream like experience when they see/hear things that happened when you were 0-4 years old? For me personally, hearing some of the music released in the late 90s/early 00s gives me this eerie feeling. I was physically there, and at some point had a lot of memories of the time but these are now mostly lost to me. But when I hear this music, even music that I didn't know until recently, something about it takes me back. Sort of in a nostalgic way, but more like an imagined past haunting me. Does anyone else get this, maybe for a different era?

Here's some examples of the music I'm talking about

I remember as a kid having really high ones a few times (I run on Celcius, so 40, 41) when I had pneumonia and going to the hospital because of it, hallucinating and stuff. But I can't recall a single fever as an adult although I have been sick often enough (flu, cold, respiratory infections, etc.).

"I have Covid and my experience is mildly interesting. I got Covid a few days ago. Since then I had headache sore throat and fever. After a two days it transfered from my throat to the nose and i gradiently lost my smelling. Taste was alright until I ate tuna in tomatoes. I tasted everything except the tuna. Then I ate french cheese (you know the smelly one) and it was the same i felt a bit saltiness but no cheese. I was a bit weirded out that I could taste salt, sweet, sour, bitter but not some specific food. 

So I searched a bit and found out that there is fifth taste Umami, which is for meat, fish or cheese. 

So here you go I could now eat Surströmming without any fear.

I few minutes ago I felt that a huge sneeze was coming and when it happened, I swear to god, it felt like my dad just sneezed.

If I were outside,I bet that the sound of me sneezing could be heard from miles away and all the dads that would hear it would be proud of me and sneeze back in response.

The funny thing is that I'm 20 years old and I'm pretty sure I'm not a dad.",2

"Lost my sense of smell and taste On Monday, I woke up with a headache on the right side of my head and my right nostril being semi-blocked. I didn’t think much of it and just took panadol. The headache would come and go and so would the pressure on my right nostril. Today (Thursday) I felt better but now I suddenly lost my sense of smell and taste. (I can smell vicks tho) I have no idea if it’s the flu or corona and chose to just self isolate. I did not have any fever, cough, sore throat, body pain, or anything. It was just the headache and the right nostril situation but now it’s the smell and taste too. I’m thinking it could be a regular flu since the weather is changing up where I live. But I don’t know what to do. 

P.s. they are not testing for corona unless you have a severe case.",2
"Just got sent home on my second week of work in a new city Just moved last week. Started my new job the day after literally. Cut all contact with everyone in my home city. Last week adjusting to a new home and city and job was hard. And very lonely. 

Went into work today which requires a temperature check before starting. I had a fever and got sent home. I just feel down. I dont want to get fired over this. I dont want to be sick. It's just making adjusting very hard.

"I just had the most intense nightmare and now I’m sitting in bed in the middle of the night with a headache and a cookie So I’ve always had this fear of someone breaking into my house. Who doesn’t at some point right? I just had something I could only describe as super close to sleep paralysis. It was essentially a non-lucid horror dream with no real chance of taking over.

I created a scenario with a psycho man threatening to track me down and then later in the night just staring and waiting for my window to open or make noises in total darkness. I’ve never felt my adrenaline spike so hard so quickly, and I have a fever, so I’m already sitting in a puddle of sweat. Then my sister screamed because a cockroach got in our drawer, which damn near gave me a heart attack but also woke me up, so I’ll take it.

Now I’m in bed, eating a cookie under the blankets with a minor headache at 11:48 pm lol. How is yalls night going?",2
"Anyone actually like getting a fever? I've always loved getting fevers.

Fever Dream

The monsters in my mind
They come after me at night
Cover up the stars
They take away my light
They tear them out like stitches
They want to haunt my dreams 
And when the moon tries to shine
They take away its beams

"It’s so hard to stay in isolation/quarantine while everyone else is going out and enjoying the summer. I feel like I’m missing out on so much but I know it’s a bad idea to go to crowded places.

Quarantine and shut downs haven’t been enforced enough in the United States so everyone is still going out, which in turn makes other people want to go out and so on.  

If this stuff was enforced more and people weren’t out going to Disneyland and stuff, then it would be a lot easier to deal with the isolation.  But just knowing that everyone else is out having fun while I’m stuck at home almost feels like torture.  And that’s why not as many people are staying home anymore.  

The quarantine and isolation and stuff should have been enforced much more and people would have had a much easier time dealing with the cabin fever, because they would know at least everyone else is stuck at home too and they’re not missing out on anything so it’s not that big of a deal.",2
"Any tips on how to break a fever? So I came down with a rather fierce case of food poisoning this morning and it sucks - had to cancel the plans I had on this pretty Saturday after weeks of anticipation, and the fever and muscle aches are making it impossible to do anything but lie down in bed and whimper sadly while accepting my fate. I'd sleep, but I've got insomnia so unfortunately I can't do anything except to wait it out while fully conscious.

"Although the whole COVID-19 quarantine situation sucks... Does anybody else find it relieving not to be pressured by social expectations of other people?

I've learnt that I'm quite the introvert and I spend all day at home on a regular basis despite the whole situation. Usually people find it strange how I can spend weeks at a time without seeing anybody, so now it's slightly amusing me that everyone else is (though it's forced) doing it too.

Personally, it feels like a big weight has been lifted off of my shoulders because I'm not expected to meet up with and talk to people constantly due to the fact that no one is essentially allowed to leave their house. I feel like I can be myself now without being judged for my lack of a social life. Does anyone else feel this way? I know that some people are going crazy with cabin fever and I understand that perfectly, but how do you think it's affecting your social life?",1

"Do you have a suspicion you may have gotten the Corona without knowing? Two weeks before all the outbreak in my country I got really sick: lots of coughing, I felt dizzy and tired all the time, had low fever and lots of difficulty breathing. I spent one week being injected with steroids (I'm asthmatic) and one week with a nebulizer. I got really scared because I couldn't breathe properly and my regular rescue meds weren't working.
At the time, there was only one confirmed case in my whole country, so IDK if it was just a real bad allergy, as two doctors told me, or we weren't prepared to detect the covid and I got it.
As a side note, I'm a teacher (yikes) and my students are mainly European children, their parents go back and forth Europe and here. And, the days before it all started I attended a course with 50 ppl, all of them from outer states.

The fever has arrived so I know this is my body cooking up the virus so I will wrap myself tightly in blankets to heat up even more and cook it.

I will drink lots of water which will purify my blood and dilute the toxins because volume of plasma increases cause water right?

If I still feel bad. I will get up and eat lots of hot soup.

If the virus is not being destroyed by my body heat I will douse myself in gasoline and burn myself so the virus dies with me.",2

They say you don't really appreciate how good it feels to not be sick until you're sick which I think is a universal truth, but I'm curious about why that is. When you're sick and you get better, you can appreciate the ability to breathe smoothly through both nostrils and not feel that sore lump in your throat, you appreciate not feeling a headache and fever, but how long does that typically last for you? A couple days? A day? Hours? Minutes? It's not something we're really conscious of but that's the whole point, do we really need to get sick to be reminded of how good we have it feeling nothing? It's weird to me how life works like that. It's nice to feel nothing after you're sick, but you can't just suck on lemons all day to appreciate the taste of nothing. Or can you?

I have a low fever that's just high enough to be uncomfortable. If I could run as much as my nose is right now I'd actually be in shape. I've taken medicine but it ain't doing much. Does anyone have any tips on surviving the torture that is a common cold?,2
Hey guys How is everyone doing today? I got up not too long ago and started a load of laundry. Now I'm sitting on the back deck watching the dogs play in the wet yard. They have cabin fever from the hurricane lol. Probably going to do some house cleaning at some point this morning. Yay adult life haha. This week was very odd as I've had four days off basically. The holiday only worked rounds then we were off for the hurricane. When I told my SO after having yesterday off I also have Sunday and Monday off he was like daaaamn do u ever work lol no he didn't say that but might of well.,1
"I haven’t gotten sick since December 2011. That is 6 years and 1 month of not even catching a cold. Last time I was sick was after a company holiday party and lasted a week. It was awful. Vomiting for 48 hours, body aches and fever for 72. Now every time I think my immune system is about to drop, I up the sleep, water intake, and take Echinacea and Zinc for at least a week. I know when my immune system is going to drop because my glands will start to feel different (not swell, but it’s hard to describe). I also know that stress does a number on the body so I do this when I’m really stressed out as well. Oh, and not much of a kid person, so avoiding them is pretty easy.",2
"I'm sick in bed, but thankful I have a support network. Like, sure, I'm laid up with some cough, body chill, fever throat thing, but I'm ok.

I can get. Doctors appointment, quickly and subsidised if needed. I have legislated sick days I can take if needed. I've got food, and don't need to worry about spending a day watching tv.

Thinking about places where this isn't a thing, just because of lack of resource, or systematic restrictions, and I can't help but be thankful.",2
"I feel bad about leaving work early because I'm sick I have a fever of 100 degrees, I left work because I was feeling dizzy. But I feel guilty and I feel like I let my boss down and I feel like he thinks I'm faking it. I've only left work sick once before in my life and that was because I was throwing up. I feel bad and I have a guilty conscience even tho I'm legitimately sick. Does anyone else feel like this after leaving work early?",2
"Being single kinda sucks Does anyone else get that same yearning feeling when sitting next to a happy couple?  My best friend and his girlfriend are sitting next to me on the couch, watching F1. I’m happy they’re happy... but I want to by happy with someone too.

Thoughts about any of this guys?


Edit: Alrighty everyone! I’m going to bed, thanks for talking with me :). I’ll post more often. And good luck to all of you singlets! I know we all can tough this metaphorical storm that is holiday fever!",0
"Sick and in bed. Someone please talk to me. I'm in bed running a  fever and have the worst stuffed nose. I hate being sick. Especially when I have no one to talk to because everyone is either busy with work or school.

Talk to me?",2
"I just called out of work with the flu. I feel like crap so i will just digest all sorts of media. Favorite movies, books, games? Anything? So i woke up last night with a heavy cough and a fever. After that i threw up off and on for a few hours before my job finally opened so i could call out. Its been a long morning to say the least. I marathoned The Simpsons for a while and now im just hanging out on reddit. What are you going to do with your sunday?",2
"Things that lift you up when you're sick Hey guys:) I'm one of the lucky people who has been sick all winter. What I'm dealing with now is getting sick twice in the last 3 weeks. I just got over the flu and now I have a cold where I have a fever, the chills, and have lost my voice. I won't whine about it any more but I thought it would give some context. 

What I really want to know is what picks you up when you're sick? I'm not looking for medical advice but what do you do to make yourself happier when really feeling down from getting ill? Any movies, drinks, foods, activities that make you feel better? I'd love to hear what memories you have connected to them.",2
"Caught my UTI within 12 hours of having it. The last time I had a UTI about 2 years ago, I was young and not bright so I sat on my symptoms for 2 weeks. The urgent care doctor who saw me was surprised that it hadn't manifested into a kidney infection.

This morning, I woke up at 2AM and couldn't sleep for a couple hours because I peed 5 times and I was having a bitch of a time. I was also having fever chills. I slept on it, knew immediately I had a UTI when I woke up, casually had breakfast at my favorite place with my SO and then headed to urgent care. I was told it was an hour and a half wait but between the wait time and getting the medication at the in-hospital pharmacy, it was a little over an hour total. 

I'm waiting for tomorrow when stuff is all fixed. I remember my first UTI, the day after I took my first round of antibiotics, my symptoms were 90 percent gone. I was almost crying of joy. 

What are your guys' stories of waiting too long to see a doctor?",2
"My cousin has a kidney infection, can everyone help with memes? She’s 16 and she’s feeling really gross and sad and sick. She’s had a fever of 103 for the past 3 days and just went to the doctor and was diagnosed. Her spirits are low, she wants so badly to hang out with her friends. I’ve been sending her memes to cheer her up. If anyone has any links to happy videos/happy memes/animals I can send her way that would be fantastic! There isn’t much I can do to lift her spirits but she is a self proclaimed meme lord, so I figure making them easily accessible to her would be good for her. Every little bit helps:)",2
"day 3ish of being sick as a dog, what's goin on everyone I've had a cold-fever-flu for a couple days and people I know are starting to catch it so here I am where people are willing shoot the shit, what's happening this week for yall.

"What are your favorite summer songs? I have mad spring fever, since it's the first nice day out in a while. I'm listening to a bunch of summer songs and feeling upbeat, wondering what kind of songs you guys like in the summer! I really like ones like ""fly"" by Sugar Ray, and stuff from around that time, but I'm also feeling the Ramones and other stuff too. Would love some recommendations! ",2
"Got sick right before Easter Hey, guys

Just wanted to check in and ask if there's anyone else that celebrates Easter but is sick right now just like me. 

What happened to you guys? How are you holding up?

I'm visiting my parents and I think I ate something seriously bad yesterday as I started vomiting last night and only recently stopped. I've been laying all day in bed, trying to keep myself hydrated. I think I'm also getting a fever now... 

I'm just glad I'm surrounded by family, I think I'd be much worse off on my own.",2
"I love modern medicine. So last night my throat started itching and I was coughing pretty badly, to the point where I couldn't even sleep right. I had horrible body aches and this morning I woke up with a fever. Thankfully, my neighbourhood has w clinic that opens early. I went to see the doctor at about 9am, and got some prescriptions. I went from being unable to sleep, to a less itchy throat, fever going down and body aches nonexistent thanks to the meds I got.

I think about how in the past, it would've been so hard to diagnose what the problem was and even harder to make the proper medicine to cure it and I feel so grateful to modern medicine. Without it, we would probably still be dropping like flies due to disease outbreaks especially considering how densely populated some countries are. To all those heroes who have contributed to medical science, named and unnamed, I appreciate the hard work.",2
"This flu is really taking its time to go away. Do any of you guys have some home remedies that help you get through the fever stage? My Uncle recommends taking a shot of vodka with garlic and pepper, but that sounds nasty.",1
"Just need to vent! Stuck at home. Feeling kinda down and could use a lift up! 

My wife left on our bike trip without me. We are training for the AIDS LifeCycle next year and were supposed to leave super early this morning to ride a 30 mile in Berkeley with our friend. It was going to be my first ""long"" ride. 

She wanted to give my bike a tune-up ahead of time, but she's been busy and hasn't had time to look at it until 11:30 last night. Well, something went wrong with the derailer and now I can't ride it at all. She feels awful. I'm upset, but what can you do? It's just a crappy situation. I told her to go have fun with our friend and not worry about it. We can go on a ride together another time.

To top it off, I left my job recently and have been stuck at home for the past week looking after our injured puppy. She's really cute but now we're both suffering from cabin fever! Call the whambulance!",1
"Got a summer flu in the middle of a heat wave :/ tell me something good about your week :) Not so bad but the heat combined with the fever is driving me bananas. I'm out of work until Monday but can barely move due to muscle soreness. Can't focus long enough to watch nexflix either. Small doses of Reddit seem to work, so tell me something good about your week.",2
"When was the last time you were sick or ill and who took care of you? I'm running a fever and have built a fort under a mountain of blankets in order to survive.

I usually go crawling to my mum's place when I'm ill but she's out of town nowadays.

So when was the last time you fell ill? Was it bad? Was anyone there to take care of you and rub your back while you whined about feeling like someone filled your mouth with sawdust?",2
"Keep me off doctor google My 2 month old has had a fever for nearly a week and we are headed to an infectious disease specialist. Keep me off dr google (because lets be real, I don't need to worry that he has HIV). Tell me what's making your day/week/month/year/life good right now.",2
"I have a sore throat, and it hurts and it sucks Update: gonna lie down with my phone next to me. If i'm lucky, I'll fall asleep if i'm not choking or something. If I don't reply, assume i fell asleep. Sorry ahead of time.


I was running a fever the other day, and had to ask for today off from work. Now it developed into a swollen throat, which makes breathing hard and swallowing painful. Even drinking water hurts. So far all I could do about it is gargle salt water, drink plenty of water(painfully), and take some lonsange(?). Literally can't afford to go to the doctor, and too afraid to tell my parents (it's complicated).

I texted my manager asking if I can have tomorrow off as well, but I feel bad for doing so. I'm scared he might get mad or something, but I don't really like the idea of working in a fast food environment in my current condition.",2
"I faked being sick to stay home Alright so yesterday I went on a field trip (I'm a HSer  by the way wherein I didn't really know anybody on the 2 hour bus trips to and from. So I felt pretty drained and came home. That evening I felt all the telltale signs of getting sick (which I believe may have come from overpriced, but under quality DC foof ( such fever, chills, weakness, and throwing up in my mouth. So I figure I must not be going to school tomorrow. I get to sleep at around midnight once I'm able to and wake at about 7:00 feeling right as rain. I tell my parents I don't feel well because I have it ingrained that im not going to school and they believe me. Now I'm sitting in bed and feeling guilty about it. What do you all think?",2

So the dream felt like real life I could move around but I never left the bed the most I moved was just sitting against the wall my bed is on, there was not a ""demon/monster"" all the horror was myself. In the dream I had several panic attacks I saw faces that took my all of my vision (you know when you stand up to fast and things go a bit dark. Instead of dark it was faces I've never seen) I heard voices and random old clothes appeared on my bed.

They badger the intern to page page page neurosurgery to ask if it's a shunt infection,  ask if they can tap it, ask if they can reset the shunt, ask if they  should get a shunt series or MRI, ask to reset the shunt after the MRI,  and maybeee tap it juuuust one more time since fevers are still  happening.

Honestly in this situation it can feel like the neurosurgeon is protecting the poor kid from the primary team, but when is it actually the shunt and how can I  best communicate with you when it's real?

"Lymphopenia / CBC-based diagnosis and clinical decision-making? Given ongoing issues with access to coronavirus testing, is there merit in checking CBCs with diffs on patients with symptoms (dry cough, fever) without known exposure right now, in order to look for lymphopenia (and potentially re-evaluate the patient if there’s more severe lymphopenia?)

Although not a particularly sensitive lab finding, if it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck... maybe we should tell the bird it has a higher chance of being a duck?

"Nurse here - why after injury do we try to suppress inflammation if this is how our body heals itself? I heard someone ask this question in class the other day and the lecturer didn't give a great answer. Like putting ice on an ankle when someone rolls it, why do we recommend this, if the ankle swelling is our body's way of dealing with the injury? Is it solely pain relief? Surely we're suppressing something useful our body is doing.

Same question for giving paracetamol for fever. Why do we do this?",1

Edit to add: I forgot there might be some people who read /r/medicine, but haven't heard of an FUO, seeing that I only just learned about it myself. An *FUO* is a fever of unknown origin. It's a fever for 3 weeks, that is still a mystery after a week of workup. The medical team here went at it for two weeks and are still going. He got all the scans.

"Medical folklore -- do you have this at your practice? My advisor and I have been having this discussion for the last week.  It seems in the USA (we are from Spain on visit to Texas, Washington DC and few other of your states), there are medical ""folklore"" cures: medical knowledge which has no basis in the literature. 

There are two examples we have been digging through the litureature to find a source but to no avail.  Talking to colleges in Norway, they found these to exist in the USA as well.  Two of our best examples are: ""SSRIs, you have to keep trying different ones with patients until one works"" and ""starve a cold and feed a fever.""  To be fair, we have heard the latter more often from nurses.

Is this commonplace knowledge in the USA?  Are there other ""folklore"" cures like this (Apologies for naming, not sure how to best describe in English).",1
"Why should vaccines generally not be given in sever (sometimes moderate) febrile illness? I somehow decided that it was partly because you were less likely to develop immunity if you had the vaccine while febrile.  I usually don't make up stuff like that, so I'm really confused about how I might have come up with this idea.  Searching for it hasn't turned up any results, there's just the indication that vaccines can cause fevers or febrile convulsions and the implication that having this happen on top of a standing fever is less than ideal.  Feeling a bit lost, was I completely off base to start with?",1

"Intentionally spreading the Zika virus? I'm really curious, I'm interested in medicine and perhaps someone may know more than I do when it comes to this (as I've never had classes on medicine, anatomy, virology in high school). Would it be a good idea to infect people with the Zika virus? Like intentionally infect groups of people if it gets too out of hand? I see a vaccine is 10 years off, the Zika virus doesn't produce any symptoms 80% of the time, if it does it seems to cause symptoms similar to a normal fever. Obviously counting out, children, the elderly, and pregnant women, would it be a good idea to purposely infect healthy individuals in order for them to build an immunity to the virus, thus causing a non-traditional form of herd immunity throughout the country? 

Probably a horribly stupid question, but curious to hear why this wouldn't work or is a horrible idea from someone more experienced. Thanks! :)",1

Fast forward to today, about 5 days after the panic. I’m still not fully mentally recovered. I’ve been dazed and constantly have a feeling of being worried, guilty about wasting my time pre-Covid, anxious about literally everything. I just don’t feel right.

but even so, there's a part of my brain that has acclimated to this bubble and feels secure in it -- and is anxious (terrified?) about going back to normal life.

because of a bunch of other changes, ""normal life"" post quarantine will look \*very\* different from my pre-quarantine existence: divorce, cross-country move, losing my social support network, family health issues, job shifts, deep and constant depression that has led to suicidal ideation for the first time in my life.

It happened again yestarday. It was my first day of band camp (I was recently made a section leader) and I was super nervous and sick. I couldnt eat I felt so bad. When I got there they did a temperature check(because of covid) and I had no fever. After about 30 minutes, my sickness went away.

Feeling bad for strangers Today I went to Home Depot for a few things and as I was waiting to check out I hear a women in panic. I saw a women laying on the floor. I’m pretty sure she was having a stroke. In that moment I froze. Personally I don’t handle emergency situations well. I’m always thinking of worse case scenarios even if it’s a simple fever. I felt so bad that I couldn’t do anything that when I left I moved my car close to a spot where I can see the ambulance. I sat until I watched her go into the ambulance and her (what I was sure is her daughter) looked a bit calmer.

I am in a part of canada with a really low count of Covid-19 but seeing the reports and all the news has been slowly grinding me down.

"How to protect your mental health when working from home amid the COVID-19 pandemic As many of us adapt to working and interacting online and being cooped up at home, it's quite likely that we might experience cabin fever. This is expressed as a series of negative emotions and distressing sensations – these include restlessness, difficulty concentrating, sleep difficulties, lethargy, lack of patience or persistent sadness among others.

"[US] Not having insurance/healthcare in the US is terrifying sometimes. I only just got my flu shot this last Friday, and I hear they take about two weeks to become effective, but my brother has come down with something, and I'm worried it's going to end up being the flu. He had a fever and soar throat yesterday, and he still has a fever today, and I'm just worried I didn't get my vaccination in time and I'm going to get sick, and the flu can be really disastrous even with proper medical care, so I can't imagine what it might do to me since I can't see a doctor. I just don't know how to relieve myself of this anticipation.

"Anxiety or Heart Issue? I went to the doctors in January after I was ill with the flu and a fever, with heart palpitations (heart rate was 98 at resting). The doctor told me I had something called Sinus Tachycardia. It lasted around a week and then subsided. The next month, it happened again but this time, lasted around 2 weeks, I went to the doctors for an ECG, but at the time of the ECG, my heart rate was normal so nothing showed. Now... it's always on my mind, I get phantom pains and it makes me panic, and I don't know if I'm having a panic attack, or a heart attack or something completely different, I feel myself blaming it on other things, like my bad back or pain in my neck causing my heart rate to elevate.

I’ve had heart palpitations for years and other stuff related to anxiety - tingling hands, indigestion, etc. But the past two weeks I’ve had constant body aches. Like how I usually feel when I have a fever but...no fever. Just aches, lack of energy, and increased appetite.

I always feel guilty when I take time off, even when I have a fever and am physically unfit to be in an office. Even as a kid I always felt like I should have been at school when I would stay home sick. It's an unshakeable guilt that almost feels just as bad as being sick does. I always feel unjustified.

Then I worry, what if I get physically sick in the future and can't go into work, but I've already used up my sick time by taking a mental health day?

I'm not saying anyone *should* feel guilty for taking time off from work for mental health reasons, just that *I do* and I need to know how to get over it. ",2

Stretching:

1. Increases your flexibility

2. Increases your range of motion

3. Improves your performance in physical activities

4. Increases blood flow to your muscles

5. Improves your posture

6. Helps to heal and prevent back pain

7. Is great for stress relief

8. Can calm your mind

9. Helps decrease tension headaches

If something major happens, they'll still go to the doctor and take the medicine they prescribe. 

In general, they're pretty healthy people, so I don't worry too much about them getting sick often. But this year, I've been really pushing them to be extra careful with the winter coming and kept asking them to get the flu shot for once.

So where does that put diagnosis for SAH beyond a 6 hr interval, if CT has good but not great sensitivity (80~%) and then LP of around ~60%. Is it just a hope that if CT comes back negative that the LP picks up the SAH that is present in that one  case ?

Looking over the guidelines for referral, I see headache, seizure, and low tone with motor delay but no mention of hypertonia. I'd love insight as to why that is. I understand the nervous system changes a lot in the first two years especially, but any time I see abnormal tone with motor delay, I want to refer to neuro.

I created a scenario with a psycho man threatening to track me down and then later in the night just staring and waiting for my window to open or make noises in total darkness. I‚Äôve never felt my adrenaline spike so hard so quickly, and I have a fever, so I‚Äôm already sitting in a puddle of sweat. Then my sister screamed because a cockroach got in our drawer, which damn near gave me a heart attack but also woke me up, so I‚Äôll take it.

"Life after a headache feels so much better I had a really bad headache since last night which lasted for about 20 hours.

if there are any spelling errors or anything
because I'm rushing this and still have a bad

"The other day I(24F) finally got an answer to why I have such terrible headaches. So I've had these absolutely terrible headaches my whole life, for a while we thought it was tension headaches. I went to many different neurologists to see what could be done, but they only gave me medication to try to fix it and none of it worked. I eventually got a brain MRI which came back with nothing. I was referred to a pain management doctor and they did everything they could, but nothing helped. Eventually, they had me get an X-Ray of my cervical spine(neck) and found out that I have Chiari Malformation Type 1(my cerebellum is 2cm past where it's supposed to be and is going down with my spine).

I never thought I would find such relief in just knowing why I get my headaches, now I just need to get it fixed! It only took 10+ years to find out what caused it.",2

"I 22M have recently gotten into the economics world, and boy is it incredible. So about 2 months ago I saw the film The big shorts with literally no knowledge on the stock market, I was thinking throughout the entire movie. All these characters showed such emotion when they uncovered new evidence and such that made me go ""what is happening, why are they acting like this"" so I tried my best to understand but I couldn't. After that film I decided to just search up what happened in 2018 with the real estate market, I searched a lot of repeated terms in the film and with all this, I was invested in the world of economics. I graduated as a software engineer last year, but I can see myself enjoying studying econimics a lot more. These last 2 weeks, I have been learning non stop, and I get headaches beacuse it's soooo much, but I love it. Has anyone experienced this feeling?

"I have Covid and my experience is mildly interesting. I got Covid a few days ago. Since then I had headache sore throat and fever. After a two days it transfered from my throat to the nose and i gradiently lost my smelling. Taste was alright until I ate tuna in tomatoes. I tasted everything except the tuna. Then I ate french cheese (you know the smelly one) and it was the same i felt a bit saltiness but no cheese. I was a bit weirded out that I could taste salt, sweet, sour, bitter but not some specific food. 

So I searched a bit and found out that there is fifth taste Umami, which is for meat, fish or cheese.

"I've had a headache for a month and I'm feeling pretty anxious I've had a constant headache for about a month in the right side of my head from my temple to the base of my skull. My right ear always feels 'stuffy' like it needs to be popped. For a while I was having phantosmia, where I would smell horrible chemical scents for a moment at random. It's starting to interfere with daily life and how well I sleep because I'm so scared I have a brain tumor or something.

Went to the doctor and they said it was likely a sinus infection. They gave me a week's worth of doxycycline and I just finished it today. Phantosmia is mostly gone but the headache is still always there. It's not very painful, just kind of a pressure (below a 5 on a 10 scale) that's always there. Sometimes it comes with random body pains and irritability. Going back to the doctor tomorrow. 

Any advice on managing my anxiety about this or what I should do? Or just something that can cheer me up? Would be much appreciated. ",2

"Contact lens wearers, am I doing this right?? What was your experience when you tried contacts for the first time? I am in the process of getting contacts. I went to the eye doc and got a trial pair and in the office I could not really see with them on. The letters on the chart looked like hieroglyphics, which I told the doc, but the Dr sent me home with 3 pairs and told me to wear them anyway. I gave it a shot for 4 hours this morning but couldn't take the blurriness, headache, and eye strain. Is it normal for an eye doc to send you home with lenses you said weren't working right? Did you know instantly when you got the right lenses on? How many visits did you have to go to before you got the right prescription? Idk I just thought this would all be easier and would love to hear your experiences. For reference, I am nearsighted and astigmatism.",2

"Has anyone else ever experienced a headache like this? Hi guys, I'm experiencing a headache unlike any I've ever had before and I was wondering if anyone could tell me how they deal with this type of headache if they've experienced before. 

It all started about four days ago when I was sitting on my bed resting against the headboard when I got a sharp pain in the lower right hand side of my skull. Since then, I've had dull pain in the lower back of my head. It sometimes eases but is mostly constant now. It gets worse when I lie the back of my head down on the pillow.

I get that Reddit is not a replacement for proper medical care but I am not exhibiting any kinds of signs of anything apart from this constant pain. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Does it eventually fade? Thanks for anything you can tell me.",2

Why? Why does my hair HURT me?? I don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôve always had really thick hair. maybe that‚Äôs it? I don‚Äôt know.

I tell her that it‚Äôs not good for her to stay up late especially since she‚Äôs always complaining about having headaches and her eyes hurting and her fear of getting sick (especially with COVID) but she just doesn‚Äôt listen. If I do tell her with a firm tone that she needs to sleep, she usually gets angry at me and tells me that she knows. But I‚Äôm only trying to look out for her since she‚Äôs my mom. Why is it that when I only want to help my mom get the best health that she just thinks I‚Äôm being unkind? It really breaks my heart. I just want her to be healthy. But there‚Äôs no way to tell her without her getting upset. Are all mothers like this?",2
Think I have corona. Can‚Äôt get tested until Monday. I woke up yesterday with a sore throat due to what I thought was not taking allergy meds in a while and sinus back up. Went out with my bro to play fris. golf and got a headache towards the end thought it was due to dehydration and not sleeping well the last few days. Today woke up with same symptoms. I have been drinking water all day and headache not getting better. Throat got a little better. But around 3 I got a terrible headache and my body started to ache like when I usually am first getting sick. Took a nap and it cure me of headache and body ache for about 20 minutes. Now I‚Äôm having stomach issues. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm very scared.,2
"Woke up feeling rough as hell this morning. Tell me it's ok to not be productive today. Woke up with a headache and rough stomach.

I was furloughed starting from yesterday and I was going to take the opportunity to finish writing my book before the end of April, I can finish my freelance work quicker, and I can catch up on my reading challenge. But pushing myself a day behind on most of those is a kick in the teeth.

And as you can guess, doing any of those things with a pounding headache is neither fun nor easy.

It might come from the sun, that reached my head most of the time today, I'm a person where that happens fairly often, but I thought: ""What if it's a stroke?"" and my god, I followed that pure thought to an extend, where I thought the symptoms where there.

My lip got heavy, my speaking was a little bit affected, I felt sick and moving seemed to be almost impossible.

With scrolling reddit, I calmed down now, everything is fine and even the headache is gone.

I think that was some sort of a panic attack or so.",2
Does anybody else ever feel hungover the morning after feeling strong emotions? I dont just mean like if you cry so much you get dehydrated I mean extreme happiness too. Usually when I wake up the morning after either being really happy or super upset I feel like I got hit by a truck. I have a headache and my heart is pounding and I feel sick. It takes me a good hour to get out of bed. It's kinda weird and I wonder if other people experience this or if it's just me.,2
"Good sleeping techniques? So It's currently 2:30 AM and I should be sleeping. I have an important exam at 11:00 AM and I haven't studied anything. 

I'm having a bad headache right now, so I went to sleep at 1:00 AM. As you can guess, I couldn't. This quarantine made my develop a super bad sleeping habit. I'm drinking a tea in hopes that it helps me. So do you have a good technique? Or what do you do to conceal sleep easily?

I made a bomb egg sandwich if I do say so myself. I‚Äôm sat in front of the my computer watching some episodes of Community. I swallow my mouth full and then Chang says something funny. I sort of snort but I feel the food rise up to my nose.

It was soooo painful.

"Tall drink of water Stress in the city makes me wanna rip my eyes out. I was on the beach a couple days ago and didn't experience any headache whatsoever. I guess my body loves being one with the water. But now I'm back in the city and the headaches are back. Usually, I'd just shrug it off or take a nap, but today, I figured I didn't drink enough water and the headaches are just my brain begging for oxygen. So I drank a tall glass of water and poof! Headache gone in a couple minutes. 

So this is just a random reminder to you random people to drink a tall glass of water today. Water is life!",2

Apparently she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt get her foot on the brake in time‚Äù and only got a warning for ‚Äúfollowing too close‚Äù when she wasn‚Äôt even that close to me. Why do they give old people a break? So ridiculous.... some of them obviously shouldn‚Äôt be driving.

It all started on Thursday when I initially got a bit of an headache and and a stomach sickness, but nothing serious.
Saturday, today, I'm feeling pretty good, however the point is that I actually haven't felt anything emotionally since then: no sadness, no joy, no anger just nothing, neither bad nor good and I'm a bit worried.
It could be due to the fact that I've been staying home the whole time (I hope so), anyway tonight I'm going to a birthday party and all my best friends gonna be there so it should be fun as hell.

"Had an appt with a new doc (neuro) today... he was so nice! I‚Äôm so hopeful! Went to a neurologist today because I‚Äôve had some suuuper intense headaches with some mood changes and such. Nothing major but something worth asking about. I felt kind of stupid... I kind of thought everyone has headaches, right? The doctor ‚Äî who admittedly I spent a ton of time finding ‚Äî was absolutely amazing! I felt like he really LISTENED to me and asked questions and asked for my opinion. He had a resident with him who was also super sweet. Such a nice feeling to leave a doctor not feeling crazy or stupid or looked down upon, and I feel so hopeful now!",2

I feel great physical and emotional pain.        So while I was taking pills to cure my headaches I realized that painkillers made feel better, so I started taking them even though I didn't hurt just because I felt happier. I'm afraid that I'm getting addicted because I take like six or seven pills a day.

"Wife's brain tumour I've been married to my wife for 19 years, we have 2 children, however we do not get on. My wife is rather volatile, and will erupt at me or the children for small things, screaming and shouting. She isn't a bad person, but cannot control her emotions at all. To be honest, she makes my life a misery, and in hindsight we should never have got married - but then again we have had two wonderful kids, who I love with all my heart, so I could never wish for that.

Yesterday my wife returned from a medical appointment - she has been having migraine headaches recently almost constantly, so had been referred to have an MRI of her brain. The results were in, and the doctors have found ""a mass which is concerning"", and want to bring her followup appointment forward.

My first reaction when she told me this was a thrill of excitement that she might die, and I might be rid of her. I feel terrible for thinking such a thing, but I undeniably thought it.

Our 7 year old was on the receiving end of a minor bullying incident back in Feb and has since been struggling with almost continuous daily nausea and headaches. He was checked by multiple GP & hospital physicians for physical causes, but the diagnosis is that he's suffering from severe anxiety, depression, and possibly PTSD. His nausea and headache symptoms are strongest when he's preparing to go to school or at school, and weakest when he's away from school and distracted by activities. 

More recently, he's had five cognitive behavioural therapy sessions with a psychologist, which has so far been unsuccessful. We've also tried physical exercise, and breathing, relaxation, and meditation exercises to no avail.

Is it a headache or worse? So I got elbow on my right side of my head  when I was playing b-ball. So far I used medicated oil on my head. I also have anxiety. I can‚Äôt tell the difference if I have anxiety headache or a real headache. Currently I am in bed and my head feels like it‚Äôs burning. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs from a lot of thinking because earlier I was listening to music and my head was not this hot. I can‚Äôt sleep right now.,2
"I might be experiencing alchohol withdrawal and I dont know what to do Hi, i stopped drinking consistently from about two weeks ago, and for about a week and a half i have been having the following symptoms-

- constant trembling in hands and if i have caffeine then everywhere
- i cant sleep, i had an hours worth a night ago and about 8 hours last night but i still feel like i havent slept in days
- bad headaches
- nausea
- fatigue (thats normal for me though)

and obviously, a need for alchohol. the last time i drank i had just gotten back from school, that's how much i needed it. i just dont know what to do, i feel so tired and  dead. how do  i stop this withdrawal?",2
"Can vision effect mental health? I asked this before on another sub but I guess no one had an answer for me. Basically I‚Äôve been dealing with mental fatigue and tension headaches for 5 years. I believe the constant tension headaches and fatigue led me into anxiety and depression since it felt like I couldn‚Äôt express my self as much and I felt a lot less sharper. It wasnt until recently that I started wearing my glasses fulltime, before I rarely ever wore them. When i started wearing them, the tension headaches and fatigue have slowly started going away and I feel a lot calmer than before. I believe that it was because of longterm continuous eyestrain that I developed anxiety and depression. What do you think?",2
"Why do I feel angry all the time? I have always felt angry and grumpy all the time, I noticed the issues started when I first enter school and I don't really know why? I feel as irritated and confuse about my behaviour home and school life are going swell.

I also started to get random headaches and stomachaches for unknown reasons. How do I fix this? What's wrong with me?",2
"Reaction between ibuprofen and bupropion? Within the last month, I started taking bupropion for a combination of anxiety and depression symptoms. 
One of my anxiety symptoms was that I could almost never sleep through the night. Almost as soon as I started taking my new medication, I was sleeping through the night again! 
I have been avoiding taking other medications with the new one to stay safe, but a few days ago I had a massive headache and did a quick search to make sure ibuprofen was safe to take with bupropion, which it is. However, after taking the ibuprofen, I couldn‚Äôt sleep through the night again.
Has anyone experienced a similar thing? I was used to not sleeping through the night already, so at least I managed. It didn‚Äôt happen again the following days either.",2
"anxiety and getting enough food This is a little gross, sorry. Also there's a brief mention of vomiting if that's not for you.

&#x200B;

I have pretty awful anxiety and it makes eating food a bit of a hassle. Even when I do end up eating something, pretty much everything that comes out of me from either end is yellow liquid of some kind. Apparently this is because my anxiety is speeding up my digestive process? I feel like that could be accurate since I'm getting loads of headaches.   
Anyways, my question is this- What are some bland foods that are high in nutrients, and are there any ways you'd suggest distracting myself while I eat to make it easier?",2
"Mertazipine and sex drive Hey all,

I've been on Mertazipine for a few years.. this is my second time being on it. I've worked my way down from 30 to 15mg and I quit about a week ago. 
Reason being, I have no sex drive at all and I've put on some serious weight dispite only having 2 meals a day. Oats in the morning and a relatively balanced dinner. So far I've not been having any major withdrawal issues. I'm sleeping ok (I'm on Xanax as well so I guess that's helping) and ofher than that.. slight headache but nothing a can't manage. 

The weight I know will take awhile to burn off and I'm ok with that.. but I'm wondering.. how long does it take for libido to return. 

First time I took Mertazipine I was single and having a sex drive or not didn't really matter. This time round I am engaged, so having a healthy sex drive is kinda important... Anyone know rough time lines for a normal libido to return?",2

I know headaches are a symptom of depression but they haven‚Äôt gone away even though the other symptoms of depression have eased off recently.

"My mental health issues were literally caused by me thinking too much For just over a year now I've had a massive headache that never goes away. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and was starting to show signs of Tourettes. About a week ago in the car i realised that I was always thinking up imaginary scenarios or thinking up hypothetical conversations, so i just decided to stop thinking and only focus on driving. Miraculously about 10 minutes later i realised that I had no headaches anymore. It's been a week now where if I find my mind wandering I just stop it and my headaches are almost completely gone and I've had no uncontrollable outbursts. Mfw I've been thinking for 13 months straight and never figured that out. Anybody else had such a stupid easy fix for their long term mental health issues?",2
"Two antipsychotics Hi folks, I‚Äôm new to the community but love exploring these subs for your experiences. 
Back in July I was in a very dark place - thought I was always being watched, afraid of falling objects, and just deep unnecessary paranoia with symptoms of OCD.
My doc prescribed Zyprexa and since then I‚Äôm up to 10mg once before bed. 
In October I went on Trintellix 10mg and it provided a lot of relief. Flash forward to December my doc now has me on Rexulti 1mg. 

My question is: Does anyone have experience taking two antipsychotics at once? 
I‚Äôve had a headache for four days now and am wondering if this is a side effect of too much antipsychotics. Trying to see my doc asap, just don‚Äôt know if he knows what he‚Äôs doing.",2

Self harm? And possible dangers? I‚Äôve made a few notes here since I don‚Äôt really have anyone to go to. But recently I started to hyperventilate to the point of passing out.

Does anyone notice when they are reading they find it really hard to control the speed they are reading? like I now have a headache because all the words just ran past my head almost at once, this happens quite often and leaves me feeling a little dizzy and sick. I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this and what I can do to get my head to chill. This kind of feeling also happens when Im hungry, bored, tired etc just my inner voice racing, for example when I'm hungry all i can hear in my head is 'hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry' and it makes staying focused really hard because there's almost always that voice telling me to do something else.",2
"catastrophizing I‚Äôm a woman with a history of generalized anxiety and panic disorder, and seasonal Affective Disorder. Add Covid to that, and I‚Äôm a mess. 

I‚Äôve been having physical symptoms lately. Symptoms that are common for me, and have been looked into previously and are well documented.  Most of the time, I can deal, I know there‚Äôs nothing new going on, spring will be here soon and the cold and dark will lessen, Covid is slowly improving, etc. 

But nighttime is the worst, I‚Äôm tired and not sleeping well, I‚Äôve had a headache for 2 days, my vertigo is acting up, and my anxiety is trying to convince me that something is wrong. Enter the catastrophizing. My mind likes to turn every little ache and pain into something terminal.

"I started antidepressants and medication for my anxiety and this is how I feel. So hey! I started going to the psychiatrist two days ago and quickly got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was in such a bad state. I just started meditation today and maybe it's just my mind tricking me but I feel so much better not as jittery and scared/anxious that I used to be. I woke up and actually dried the dishes and made my bed. 
My symptoms yesterday were diarrhea (but not bad), naseau and little appetite. 
Day 2 I still feel overall my anxiety is under control. I feel pretty happy. 
My symptoms I pooped my pants yikes I know. Diarrhoea, little appetite, I have a bad headache and little sleepy today. But lol otherwise I feel good but I been in bed after taking a bath.

"Lexapro and a Dull Headache Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôve listened to my doc and started a script of Lexapro 5 days ago. He prescribed me 10mg a day, but I‚Äôm splitting the pill in two to ease myself in. 

Things have been fine for the most part aside from this dull headache that sits at the back of my head. Is this normal? I‚Äôve been taking Advil/Tylenol to deal with it, but at this point I can‚Äôt tell if the headache is sourced to the lexapro or rebound symptoms from the pain relievers (I‚Äôll be clear that it was there before I started the pain reliever doses, so leads me to believe it‚Äôs the lexapro). 

Did you get similar symptoms? Did it go away after some time? I‚Äôd like to stick with the drug for a little while but the headache sucks. Thanks",2
"My friend with bipolar and BPD is the only person who 'gets' me when I'm down. I have anxiety and Cyclothymia and yesterday on top of that I had a headache that just wouldn't shift. My friend has been trying to encourage me to start eating healthy again (which I keep saying I want to do) and this week she's sent me a diet book and a food diary. I know it comes from a good place, but it feels like I'm going to let her down if I don't stick to it. It just feels like too much pressure. 

I didn't mean to but I upset her yesterday when I told her that. Honestly I know she only wants to help and support me, but no amount of cook books or food diaries are going to help unless I actually WANT to do it myself. I must have sounded so ungrateful but my mood was really low and my head was telling me that this was a form of her trying to control me. Of course it wasn't, and we're ok now - I just spent all of last evening feeling like shit because of how my stupid brain works.",2

For example, my mom always shouts at me for being irresponsible, I never reacted much. But, these days I have not been the same. I argue back, venting out my anger. I am afraid that I will say something bad to her. 

I feel like people judge me in every angle. I decided to quit social media because of toxicity. Still, I am not getting better. I am not able to sleep for more than 10 days. I get frequent headaches, unable to concentrate on studies.

And I only feel like I'm worrying about things, when I'm thinking about worrying about worrying about things. It's really fucking dumb. And I'm doing so good otherwise.

Some days there are tears, but most of the time it's a feeling without the tears. I rather sob and let the emptions out to feel better. Instead of dry crying for sometimes hours

The urge to cry overwhelms me no matter how positive I try to be. It's weird because the amount of emotions I feel lately would make me cry a waterfall in the past.

Especially if I'm focusing on something that also stresses my out, like a particular class I'm in this semester. It's crazy how a switch had been flipped in my body and that's the new way I react to stress. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Maybe not even headaches specifically, but has a big event changed the way your body reacts to stuff physically? It's pretty crazy and I'm curious if y'all have similar stories.",2
"My first dad sneeze and I'm not even a dad. This morning I woke up and to my surprise I was welcomed by the usual symptoms of a cold.Like headache,throat pain and later fever and sneezes.

I few minutes ago I felt that a huge sneeze was coming and when it happened, I swear to god, it felt like my dad just sneezed.

If I were outside,I bet that the sound of me sneezing could be heard from miles away and all the dads that would hear it would be proud of me and sneeze back in response.

The funny thing is that I'm 20 years old and I'm pretty sure I'm not a dad.",2
"I genuinely believe that headaches are the most painful things a human being can experience -- and yeah, I'm suffering one right now...

Still, unlike the other days when this happens to me, today I fought the urge to take some pill to take care of it, so I endured the headache.  
  
And... at about 11am the headache passed and I'm feeling totally positive about life (ok, it's friday...)!

I've graduated from a fellowship program, and it's been a headache getting reimbursed for my book fund (although other fellows got theirs).

"Medical plants of shame? I am a family doctor from Lithuania.
Lately here has been a huge increase in strange Russian products. One of them is umckaloabo plant extract.

Won't it be much safier? We do not whant your pig pharma drugs"". 
And no mater what I do, I can't argue with the propaganda machine.

So I've decided to plant the actual plant in my office (we can have plants at most workplaces) and put a pair of google eyes on each leaf everytime anybody asks ""what about that extract"".

"Is allowing a fistula tract to form before repairing an intra-abdominal perforation acceptable practice? I posted this question to /r/surgery without a reply.  Let's see if there are takers here.

---

I seek guidance from the esteemed surgeons of this subreddit regarding this question. I've recently seen several cases where a patient developed a perforation of a hollow viscus in the abdomen. Instead of immediately taking the patient to the OR to repair it, it was allowed to continue until it formed a fistula tract, such as to the skin or perhaps another hollow organ, such as the bladder or vagina, and only then would exploration commence. Meanwhile, the patient would rage with sepsis, often for weeks on end, causing no end of headache to my service (critical care). Is this an acceptable practice for hollow viscus perforations/leaks, and so, under what circumstances is this the preferred surgical strategy, as opposed to immediate repair?",0

I kind of want to escape escapism in a way. Its sounds contradictory.

This might be due to my occasional depressions and lack of wanting to go out into the real world. Anyone know why this is happening? Thanks alot anyways",0
"Feelings of Nervousness I am seeking some guidance, because our dear old friend Google has not helped me at all. 

Recently I have been having more and more moments of nervousness without any logical cause. It just happens. I get that nervous pit in my stomach. However there are no other symptoms, no other signs of generalised anxiety, no overthinking, etc. It almost feels like a medical symptom, like how you can have a headache or feel nausea. The only thing I can think of is just the general state of the world with COVID. 

Is there anyone with a clue as to what this might be? Are there versions of anxiety disorders, where it's just nervousness? Does anyone know of any physical medical ailments that cause just nervousness. 

I understand there isn't a lot of info here, so I am happy to answer any questions. I just don't know what would be relevant.",1

"PCI is recommended within 12 hours of symptom onset AND within 60-90 minutes from first medical contact. I don't understand the reason why the 60-90 min clause is included. Shouldn't it be: PCI is recommended within 12 hours of symptom onset. Minimize this time (douh!) because the person is having a heart attack!

For example, these two contradictory cases:

Patient A: at -12 hours gets symptoms, seeks late medical attention and first contact at -5 hours, gets PCI within 90 minutes. Total time to get PCI was 8.5 hours.

Patient B:at -12 hours gets symptoms, seeks medical attention right away at -11 hours. Gets PCI within 120 minutes. Total time to get PCI was 3.0 hours. 

The guidelines could say: minimize one variable: total time from first symptom to PCI < than 12 hours, then recommend PCI. The 60-90 min window is additional (irrelevant?) information.",1

Losing an uncle to lung cancer at 50, and another at 60 from a heart attack (following a stroke from cigs), was such a darn shame. That‚Äôs why I hope this guy is doing well and lives a long life. It‚Äôs all I can really hope for.  ",2

"Boyfriend survived double bypass and is doing great! ‚ÄòFound‚Äô my soulmate in my forties after an abusive marriage and the deep, dark depression that followed. Fought my way back with therapy and bettering myself. Then reconnected with a friend I had known for many years who also divorced and survived a bad marriage. I admitted I had had a crush on him a long time ago but was too shy to tell him. He said he too had a crush on me and was also too shy.

We met and it was an instant connection. A year later, he nearly died from a heart attack (genetic condition in the family). I have lost three family members to heart issues (one parent, one sibling, and a grandparent), so this scared me so so much. I thought I was going to lose this amazing guy. But he came out of his surgery with flying colors. His sternum is healing. He is taking it day by day.

I‚Äôm just so happy he‚Äôs still with me. I had to share that with someone. Also, to anyone else who has had a bypass, I hope you are doing well.",2

She is only 47 and has had 3 major heart attacks (completely flat lined) and 2 minor ones. I am only 24 but i pretty much handle all of her medical stuff and its pretty stressful. Anyone else have a similar situation that could give me some general advice on stress management and maybe some ideas on how to pass time while playing the waiting game in the hospital.

"About a year ago I made a post on this Subreddit About a year ago I made a post on this subreddit that I was afraid my dog would die soon as she was approaching the age of 12. I asked everyone for tips and stories of their pups. Well, yesterday was the day. My sweet girl passed away from a heart attack 10 minutes before I got home from work. She was going to turn 13 in May. My heart hurts so much and I already miss her more than anything, but I‚Äôm just glad she isn‚Äôt suffering anymore. 

She was such a vibrant, healthy and happy dog. She was a Chihuahua, but she was sooo far from the stereotype. She loved people. She would cuddle with everyone she would meet and everyone would always tell me how good of a dog she was. She was one of a kind. 

RIP My sweet girl.",2

Chest and heart pains from inflammation (they figured out it was a virus attacking me, not a heart attack). Don't get hydro's for another hour.

"I miss my grandma. Hello all, I was washing some dishes and started to remember some memories from the past. My grandma came up into my head. She passed away a few years ago from a heart attack, with Alzheimer's. 

I was just remembering this one time when I had bought a ocarina and I was determined to learn it. My family, especially my cousin, thought it sounded horrible. One afternoon, only me and my grandma was in the house. She came over and leaned against the doorway as I played it. She was laughing at me. It was a lovely moment still, because she was already losing herself. I hadn't heard her laugh in quite awhile.

Tell me about your happy memories! Maybe of people that have passed, or someone that's still in your life? ",2
"What should you do when you're with a friend as they receive a devastating message about someone they love? I was right there when my friend found out her dad is having a heart attack and is being taken to the hospital. I had no idea what to do. I put my arm around her shoulder and hugged her, I hoped it would feel somewhat less anxious as she was trying to call her mom, but our other friend told me I was just making it harder. I wanted to do my best so bad but I had no idea what does someone feel in a situation like that. When I had to leave, I just said I wish her the best and that I love her. I thought just showing support and having her not feel alone at that moment should be the most I could do, but apparently I was wrong, so I'm left very confused.

UPDATE: HER DAD IS OKAY! She just texted me saying they arrived at the hospital and he is feeling better. I'm so glad.",2
"I had a strangely paranormal experience. So about two months ago I had a vivid dream that I was living at my grandparents's house with my mother and father. In the dream, somebody was breaking into the house and me and my father were trying to defend the home. My father was killed by the intruder, and soon after the intruder was killed by me. I went and woke up my mother and told her my father had died, then I sat there staring at the floor. Then I woke up. But when I woke up, I knew it was a dream, and I didn't care about the dream at all. But I felt like something was painfully wrong, so much so that I started crying, no joke. Like something extremely tragic had just happened. I cried for about ten minutes before going back to sleep. But when I woke up, I got a call that my grandfather died of a heart attack in the middle of the night.

Am I bat-shit crazy for thinking that the ""thing that was wrong"" was that my grandfather died, and I knew it some how?",2
"My dad and his reality When my dad was growing up he never really had anything for himself. When he got his first job, his mom and sister took his pay check. They'd ask him to do everything and more most of the time. I've been riding around with him for a while  since he is my main source of transportation to college. He tells me stories about himself and his endeavors. In all my dad's stories he is some how the hero or at least special in some way. He's the kind of guy who has a strong belief in god and lizard people walk among us. He also quotes the bible a lot as his credited resource and believes the earth is 2,000 years old. My dad was a truck driver and had a heart attack 3 years ago, so he had to have a early retirement. I can't help but think of him as Rex from the glass castle. Is this some kind of coping mechanism or something? From what's happened in his life? Sorry for the long post!",2
"Another person I work with died over the weekend. That makes three people now, within the last 18 months or so, who worked in my small building and have died.  Two of them were from natural(ish) causes.  One had a stroke/heart attack and was on life support for a while.  One had some medical issues, probably stemming from obesity.

This latest guy was killed in a hunting accident.  In polite, rural America ""hunting accident"" is sometimes legitimately a hunting accident and sometimes a euphemism for suicide.  So I'm not sure exactly the circumstances.  I just talked to that guy on Friday.  Not like we were close or anything, but I saw him every day.

Never worked at a place where so many people die before they retire.  It's weird.

Not sure what exactly I want to converse about exactly.  All I know is that the older you get, the more people around you keep falling over dead.  ",2
"Moving this weekend. We had to take our cats to our new apartment today and while I was taking some stuff in, one of them bolted out the door. It was just into a hallway, not outside or anything, but I had to chase him down and he gave me a heart attack.

"What's the stupidest thing someone has said to you today? I'm at a bar partaking in the local music scene. Between acts, I go out front to have a smoke. While I'm out there, an ambulance comes racing up the street and pulls into a McDs lot. 

Minute or 2 later, the cover charge woman steps out of the bar and puts a smoke in her mouth. Looks up the street at the McDs and goes

Her ""Looks like someone had a heart attack at McDs.""  
Me ""oh is that what happened?""  
She shrugs ""Dunno. it's McDs.""

Lights her smoke and blows out the first drag ""you get what you pay for.""

"My biggest fear For the past few weeks I became more and more afraid of my dad dying. My dad is 58 years old (I'm 24) and still perfectly healthy, working full time and no medical history whatsoever. My uncle (my mother's brother, barely 51) however, was recently diagnosed with pancreas and long cancer which are both uncureable. My grandfather from my mother's side died from a heart attack when he was 57. When my father turned 58 in May I suddenly realised how mortal he is. My father and I are very much alike, and we didn't have a great relationship when I was growing up. Having the same characteristics made us clash a lot. Our relationship greatly improved in the last few years and we are very close now. Somehow I'm now scared shitless that I could lose him suddenly. I haven't told anybody this yet but I had to write it off my chest. ",2

The most lingering ones would be a sudden heart attack, or a visual of my heart basically bursting- which I‚Äôm aware isn‚Äôt quite possible. I guess. I‚Äôm not quite sure. And then, I guess I start feeling feelings around my chest after.

I am working with a therapist, but I have full-blown health anxiety now, and it's been absolutely ruining my life. I am looking to talk to someone who has had the disorder and has moved past it. Anyone?",2
"I will eventually die someday. i honestly never thought about death until last month, when my uncle passed away unexpectedly due to a heart attack. ever since then, i keep thinking about the fact that everyone has to leave someday and that my memories with my friends, my family etc, will just fade away. that i will cease to exist someday. it makes me feel like the entire universe is so morbidly vague and no happiness or God truly exists. 

this has been affecting me in my studies, i sometimes end up crying because of it . it shows me how scared i am of death and being insignificant. I've been becoming less motivated to perform daily activities as well.

is this normal? aM i doing something wrong here??

I'm kinda really young, just 15. is this normal to think like this during this period?",2
"Feeling numb I don't know if this the right place to share this but I really dont know what to do. I received a phonecall earlier and I was told my dad passed away from a heart attack, he was only 53. My family is under the impression I'm the grieving daughter at home, one of my cousins wants to send me a card/flowers but the truth is I don't feel anything. I had a little cry when I first found out but it was short, I honestly don't know how I feel. Iv had messages saying that they are sorry to hear about my dad, the main reason I think i feel Numb is because my relationship with my dad wasn't the best, he physically and emotionally abused me throughout my whole life eventually I just cut him out my life. But surely I should feel something? Surely this isn't normal? I really hope I'm not the only one that feels like this",2

Lately my anxiety has been so so bad, I can't stop obsessing over every single fear I have.

I have so many fears. Fear of having a heart attack, fear of failing college, fear of losing family members or pets... I could go on forever.

But lately I've been so scared I'll develop a mental illness like schizophrenia because it sounds so scary, and I feel like I have such a hard time controlling my mind that it might just happen.

I can't sleep at night because I'm always scared I'll hear voices anytime.

But when I‚Äôm in a serious situation, I feel as though the emotions are numb, I don‚Äôt feel the emotions I SHOULD feel. For example, a few years ago I attempted suicide, I crashed my car into a ditch and nothing happened I wasn‚Äôt injured, but I just sat in the car and I didn‚Äôt cry, feel scared, I felt nothing.

"Chest Pain? So I've been doing TMS for about two weeks now to help me feel better. Unfortunately, as it starts working, it affects your brain by giving you pretty bad mood swings which pretty much means I am almost incapacitated by either a crushing need to end my life or the feeling I'm going to have a heart attack from anxiety. 

Though my pain existed before this, I don't know if the anxiety is making this worse. For about a month I've been having off-and-on chest pains that vary with severity. It ranges from about 1-3 times a day and from minor to considering calling an ambulance.

Is this just anxiety or should I get it checked out?

I'm so scared that I'm going to die suddenly with a heart attack or a stroke or a drop in blood pressure. I couldn't sleep well last night because I was afraid of sudden death. Logically, I know it's irrational and ridiculous to even think that, but I can't help it. I want to calm down but I can't seem to know how.

About 45 minutes after doing coke I felt all the listed symptoms and had the most intense all-encompassing pain in my chest and torso, it felt like my insides were on fire. I began fading and losing consciousness and couldn‚Äôt comprehend anything being said in the room. I rushed to my room to lay down but I continued losing consciousness so I got up and drank some water frantically and sat up so I could get blood flowing to other parts of my body.

I remember one vividly, it was a rather portly african american kid who wanted to fight me after school. He got a little confrontational which caused him to be sent out of class.

As he was walking out, I said aloud so that everyone could hear. 

""Motherfucker would have a heart attack before he threw the first punch!"" The whole class laughed and even the teacher was impressed enough that he didn't made me go out too. 

I also remember ""Idiot is as bright as a broken bulb!"" 

There was a guy who basically said ""I want to keep my A in this class."" Before I immediately and instinctively quipped with ""It's your only A."" 

I was an asshole, but I do kind of miss my quipps, haven't been doing them since I started to be more respectful to others.",0
"I don't know what to do My parents think I'm gay (which is probably why I got kicked out), and I am, but I had to lie to them for years, telling them I'm not, simply because they were so abusive about it. My grandmother thinks I'm going to find a wife and have children.  I just go along with it, which makes me feel awful because I feel like I'm lying to her too. I'm pretty sure if she found out, she'd literally have a heart attack.

There's a girl around my age that likes me, which has got her father watching me like a hawk. Which goes back to my grandmother. She's met her a few times and thinks I should try to date her. I don't know what to do there. I'm trying my best not to lead her on.

I don't want people thinking I'm someone I'm not. But I don't think I have the guts to come out to anyone. Only a handful of people on Reddit knows and that's it.",0
"My heartrate was high today and it scared me I was on r/gonewildaudio, listening to a clip, and as I felt myself getting hard I decided that I was just going to listen and not touch myself. Well, the weird thing is, I felt myself getting harder and harder, and eventually a strong tingly sensation came over my cock. I thought I was going to jizz, but instead my erection begins to weaken and my heartrate was racing, it made me feel really scared, like I was going to get a heart attack. Now, here I am wondering just what the hell happened, and if it's worth talking about this with someone.",2
I need help Does anyone kinda get weird sensation in your left arm when you get anxiety.. its like its weak. Also I wake up not breathing sometimes. Constantly checking my heart rate. I pray every night i live another day. I dont have any friends so i cant talk to anyone about my anxiety. When my dad committed suicide I've gained 50 pounds and a drinking problem that gave birth to this. I also have night panic attacks a few times a week were I jolt up out of sleep feeling like my heart is about to explode grabbing my heart rate monitor. This has been going on for a year and 6 months. I have anxiety about  having an heart attack or stroke and it makes it worse. I've spent so much money to fix this like bath supplies and cbd items.. I've got supplements and stopped my drinking. when my arm feels weird I put icy hot on it to distract me from stroke possibilities... Idk the answers to my problem but please if someone knows how to fix me... please let me know. :/,2

I‚Äôve never felt my adrenaline spike so hard so quickly, and I have a fever, so I‚Äôm already sitting in a puddle of sweat.

Anyway, i get woken up around noon by Nana to tell me that she sent the keeper away early because she was ""coughing up a storm"", which obviously gave me a heart attack since...y'know.

A few weeks later, it was my birthday, and I came down with a 24-hr stomach bug the night before! At this point I could tell my co-workers and boss were getting suspicious.
 
Not one month later my boss was having us stay overtime after work and I was hit with a severe migraine around lunch. This time I could tell that my boss definitely didn‚Äôt believe me.  
 
At that moment, while I was leaving the office building with the sunshine beating down on my pulsing headache, the reason why I got sick on all those days became apparent. I‚Äôm a pathological liar that hates to work.  ",2
"I fake migraines to get out of situations I actually suffer from chronic headaches and migraines but not as often anymore due to a preventative headache med I‚Äôve been taking. 
However, I have been and still do fake migraines to get out of things I don‚Äôt want to do. 

It‚Äôs been going on since basically freshman year of high school and I‚Äôm well experienced with how to fake a migraine, so I get away with it easily. 
 It really also helps me get out of situations I‚Äôm already in, or ones I‚Äôm too depressed to even attempt. Most recently I‚Äôve just been using the excuse to get out of going to class",1
"I lied about my migraines for years bc I thought it was a more respectable issue to stay inside all day than anxiety. I hate myself for being so afraid of the unachievable goals I set for myself that I started faking migraines after I got a real one when I visited New York when I was 11. I got a lot of sympathy and was able to split off from my Girl Scout group that I didn't want to hang around (couldn't relate to them, felt outcasted) and just went off adventuring with my Mom after I recovered. I do get migraines, just not as severe and as frequent that I make it out to be. I'm about to be 19 right now and have taken it to the point where whenever I get a panic attack, I fake one and take time to recoup/recover myself. It snowballs quickly.",2
"I'm way too dependent on painkillers. Not sure if this is the right place, but I think I'm starting to acknowledge a possible issue I might have. 

I'm constantly dealing with some sort of pain. It's been this way for years now. Sometimes it gets bad, but majority of the time it's just tolerable pain that's always there. It can be random pain like a sharp stinging on the left side of my head or my knee, to specific pain like migraines and cramps, chest pain or lower back pain. I'm always taking advil or tylenol because I'm just so sick of dealing with this pain. I recently had my wisdom teeth removed and it hurts like hell. I took codeine for the first time ever and its like... heaven. I'm trying to be as careful and responsible as I can to avoid dependence but at times I feel the urge to just numb myself and fade away from reality.. to just sleep in peace and pain-free forever (not talking about death. I just want to not feel anything anymore).",2
"Can you tell the difference between a hemiplegic migraine vs an ischaemic stroke as a first presentation to ED? What on the history and exam helps? Do they present quite differently or can they have very similar presentations?
Can ct heads help initially or do they just rule out hemorrhagic stroke?
Can an MRI brain help and if so, can this readily be obtained early on in a presentation?

How can you safely avoid thrombolytics in those who present with such migraines acutely within the window for use of those drugs?

I do not work in an emergency department, this just crossed my mind and I'm left a bit curious.

Thanks guys",1
Amitriptyline and topiramate no better than placebo for pediatric migraine ,1
"Topiramate and oral contraceptives I've seen various conflicting data about taking topiramate for migraines (or seizures) interacts with oral contraceptives and makes it less effective, but read an article that topiramate dosage has to be 200mg + to effect metabolism of estrogen in birth control. Any thoughts? ",1

"This Is Getting Weird Songs and voice keep relapsing into my head... it's almost like I'm hearing them live. I get random migraines when looking at miscellaneous images & certain colors. When I'm in a better mental situation, looking (or even \*remembering\*) about them will make me relapse into a small migraine again. I would feel a bit sick afterwards. 

Also a bit confused. I'm borderline between some affection, to emptiness, to violent urges towards my mother.",2
"Can Anyone help recognise these symptoms please? Hi guys, I‚Äôve got a doctors appointment on the 18th and want to know where to direct my enquires; if anyone has similar symptoms could you please let me know so I‚Äôm better informed going in, it might be prudent to note that I don‚Äôt fear social interaction, would be considered confident and professionally I‚Äôm doing well (however I do have weeks where even showering and eating breakfast takes up all my effort). Thanks for any help. 

Symptoms -

Stress migraines which need medication to fix (amatriptlyne & propananol)

Extreme situationional anxiety to the point of throwing up and not being able to eat (fear of pregnancy) 

Social reclusion 

Suicidal ideation as a solution to problems 

Weeks of high moods and subsequent weeks of low moods 

Overthinking and constant planning to deal with current and future events 

Frequent daily naps",2
"My anxiety regarding my longevity is eating away at me Hi Reddit, I have been anxious about this for almost 4 months now to the point where its affecting my relationship with my family, as I heard sleep directly links to long lifespans according to many supercentenarians.

For some information, I'm 19 and usually sleeps for 8-9 hours on average, I don't have any bad habits such as smoking or anyone who does in the family. However, like many students whose studies has been affected by COVID19, I was pressured to pull an all-nighter and animate for 36 hours in front of my computer (no snoozes in between) for two separate incidents last year (Final projects.) During the 36 hours I recall having migraines and having mild chest pains and migraines which went away after I got the sufficient rest. 

I looked around online, and I found out sleep deprivation links to heart attacks and Alzheimers which further elevated my concerns.

Any support or feedback would be appreciated cheers!",2
Why are anti depressants prescribed for absolutely everything? So I have been to the dr for many reasons over the course of the past few years. My doctor is one of those drs who prescribe anti depressants for everything im convinced. Got poison ivy? Anti depressant. Catch pnemonia you get anti biotics and an anti depressant. Fracture ur foot anti depressant. Have surgery...anti depressant. Jus recently got diagnosed with RA its excruciating whatd i get an anti depressant. I have daily migraines whatd I get an anti depressant.. which i have seen zero improvement n the past 6 months i been on it.I believe there's a place for them such as people with mental health issues. Maybe it'll help some ppl. But for me it just makes me sick and does absolutely nothing to treat my RA or chronic migraines.. why do doctors insist on pushing anti depressants where there simply uneffective?,2
"Sudden sick feeling - wanting to die Guys, let‚Äôs start by saying I am not suicidal. Years ago I had those thoughts, and I never have them now. I do have PTSD, depression, anxiety. But what‚Äôs been strange lately is this feeling I get very suddenly and it only lasts maybe 5 minutes before I physically get up and do something and it releases me. 

The first time I was in a hospital bed with a migraine. Time felt like it was passing insanely slow. I get a nauseated feeling. I thought, this is so uncomfortable just existing. Just time passing so slowly. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to continue living if it‚Äôs going to be like this. I can‚Äôt even sit and have peace because it feels so empty, the passing of time literally hurts.",2
"Can't seem to stop until I've completely destroyed myself Just overall exhausted. I can't stop clenching my jaw even when I conciously try to relax it. Horrible migraine all day, no relief. Running myself ragged inside with guilt and freaking out that I broke the law somehow or did something so wrong my life is over. Called lawyers freaking out and worried and they all told me the same thing: you didn't break the law. Yet, I can't shake this need to ""turn myself on"" or that ""the authorities"" are going to ruin me. 

I can logically see all of this makes absolutely no sense, but I feel powerless to stop it. I just can't calm down at all. I'm completely miserable and have regressed so far as a person I'm unrecognizable. I miss being ""me"" instead of whatever this is I've become. A shut in, no friends, no job, no future. Convinced I'm going to be jailed and my reputation destroyed. Constantly running the scenarios through my head. I just want some peace.",2
Have you had any breakdowns lately? Loaded question I know. It‚Äôs been awhile but sometimes I feel like my emotional weight is too much to bear and something happens that pushes me into a full on breakdown that lasts for hours. Crying so much that my eyes swell and I get a migraine. It hasn‚Äôt happened in a long time but I wanted to hear your thoughts and experiences if you guys wanted to share. These moments are good and bad I feel like. I always feel so emotionally drained after to the point that I feel nothing and it‚Äôs kind of nice but also weird.,2
Is there such a thing as like empathy pain or symptoms? Recently I‚Äôve notice when I‚Äôm around my best friend I‚Äôll get like random issues come out of nowhere or I‚Äôll get them after she says that she has them. Like I‚Äôll start to feel tired randomly then she will say she wants to go home and take a nap because she‚Äôs tired. My stomach randomly started to feel upset and I got a migraine out of nowhere today as well and when we were out she said she felt like she had to throw up then got a headache. Is there such thing as empathy symptoms or like randomly getting the same ailments as someone else you‚Äôre close to?,2
"A different sort of tired I didn‚Äôt have to get up to an alarm clock. I didn‚Äôt have to shower, dress, and commute. I didn‚Äôt work on my feet or at a desk for eight plus hours and fight traffic back home.  

But I‚Äôm tired.  

I got about 4 1/2 hours of sleep last night broken up into a couple of naps. I managed the kids‚Äô morning routine, got the oldest to their appointment and back and before I had a chance to have lunch, was on the road again for my hair appointment. What I‚Äôd hoped would be relaxing ended in a panic attack out of nowhere that lasted so long my Fitbit registered a cardio workout. I made it home and cooked dinner, and upset everyone when my stomach was still too unsettled to eat with the family. No food all day triggered a migraine so when bedtime finally came, yes, I said I was tired. 

It‚Äôs just a different sort of tired.",2
"Asking for an altered schedule At my job, I worked 9-5 after years of 8-5. That extra hour in the morning was a lifesaver for me, as I often suffer from insomnia nights in a row, which really exacerbates my issues with depression, anxiety, migraines...


Then COVID happened and I was laid off - when I came back, I had to return to 8-5. I hate it. I can feel my mental state slipping and I dread the winter months when overall mental state is much worse and insomnia is worse.


I want to ask for my old schedule 9-5 back, but fear I‚Äôll be met with ‚Äúeveryone else does 8-5‚Äù and being made out to seem like it‚Äôs some entitlement thing. In reality, I just want to feel mentally okay and keep my job, which I‚Äôve been at for 7 years.

I don‚Äôt want to be a squeaking wheel, but I want to advocate for myself because I want to be able to function and not spiral downward mentally 


Any advice?",2
"I feel so guilty for taking ""mental health days"" off work I am the first person to preach to others how important self-care is, how we as people with mental illnesses shouldn't feel guilty about our illness and our needs, how if this was a physical visible illness going home from work sick would be totally no big deal, yet here I am. I'm having a bad mental health day, I'm just depleted and I can't focus on anything, I feel empty and drained. I really dislike my job so it doesn't take much to tip my brain into ""fuck this"" mode. If I went home, I would instantly relax, probably read or go for a walk, but I'd feel like I did something wrong by leaving.

I feel SO guilty. I grew up watching my parents push through bad days, migraines, sickness, etc. to go to work for the sake of duty, hard work, responsibility, and not using excuses to get out of things. Now when I feel awful and need to take the day off, I feel terrible, which only makes me feel worse. It's a never-ending cycle of hell.",2
"I've noticed a pattern Every month I tend to have these extremely depressive periods where I feel absolutely hopeless and there is no point or reason in doing anything. Sometimes it's painful but mostly I feel numb. I'm unable to work they way I would normally. I love learning, studying and doing things. I know that there is hope and that there is meaning and that I'm capable but during such episodes it's like someone turns off my switch, the suicidal thoughts come back. I don't feel like myself. I also have migraines well they are hereditary but the doctor said that most of them are stress induced. I feel sick a lot of the times, jaw pain, stomach aches, body aches. What do I do? Right now I really need to study and focus on work. I end up losing a lot of time and health because of this. Last year my weight dropped by 4kgs so I just don't like where all of this is going.",2
"What exactly is my brother‚Äôs issue? I get his charger for him, it‚Äôs outside.

I take an extra step, plug it in for him just because.

He goes in living room with the lights off, then randomly calls me in to turn on the light and check the thermostat. I ask why he can‚Äôt do those things.

> Ugh I have a migraine!

Then he calls me a name or whatever and made fun of me. I told him he‚Äôs lucky I‚Äôm in a decent mood and didn‚Äôt walk away entirety.",2
"Am I crazy? Paranoid or just anxiety? So recently this thing has been happening to me the past couple of weeks. I keep getting these random intrusive negative thoughts. Example being 'someone's watching you' 'somethings going to grab you' 'what if you got in a car accident right now'. They're completely random and it's getting worse and honestly starting to scare me. I'm not already thinking those things and they're not just snowballing in my mind it's literally just a thought like that and then I go back to what I was doing or originally thinking. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, insomnia and migraines. I'm not a naturally anxious person it's mostly social anxiety and I really don't understand what is bringing on these thoughts? Is it paranoia or some sort of psychosis? Maybe just too much stress?",2
"Does drinking on antidepressants cause these symptoms for anyone else? I‚Äôve been on Lexapro since February, and of course I was advised not to drink at all on this medication. But I was told by friends it‚Äôs okay to drink a little. Unfortunately I‚Äôm realizing that drinking on this medication is not fun at all for me‚Äîafter 1 drink, I typically feel sleepy, not drunk. Depending on the strength of the drink, I‚Äôll get an instant headache or migraine too. It really sucks, it‚Äôs like my body can‚Äôt take alcohol at all anymore. I‚Äôm chalking this up to the medication, but part of me also wonders maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm getting older (I‚Äôm only 23 though?). I wanna hear the effect of drinking on antidepressants for everyone else here.",2
"A thank you message for those who helped me through my mental breakdown this year It's normal to talk about help you've received for physical set backs -- I mean, it's fine to complain about a migraine, but not a bad day with your depression (nobody says ""you have no reason to have a migraine""), so it took some courage to openly talk about my mental breakdown this year, but I really wanted to thank the people who helped me, so I made a video.

"Doctors appointment So, I have been feeling anxious and sad for a couple months now. I have been just trying to deal with it but I think I‚Äôm finally going to make an appointment with my doctor to get looked at. I honestly have been feeling depressed, but don‚Äôt really have anything to be depressed about. I just don‚Äôt want my doctor to brush me off like it‚Äôs nothing.

"I'm just gonna say it here. I just recovered from a migraine. My migraines are not so frequent as they used to be! Well the past 7 years I suffer from constant migraines. But the last 3 years were the worst of my life! Strong migraines every 2 days, sometimes every day. Excruciating pain, sensitivity to light, smells and sounds and complete inability to live my life. Lately I'm on a new pill and vitamins. My migraines are less intense, I could say they're even tolerable. And the past month I have one every 7-10 days, which for me is a win! I learned to celebrate every day without a migraine. I didn't know something we all take for granted would make me so happy",2

Every month or so I suffer from a migraine that lasts anywhere from 4-10 hours. A large chunk of that time is spent seated on my bathroom floor in total darkness rocking back and forth. My senses go on overload and I need to sequester myself. I can smell better, see better, I can taste the air around me.

Didn't seem like I wanted to be there? Because I had no reason to most of the time. I literally had to beg for tasks to do.

I was so happy to finally get a job during this tough time, and excited to do the work I thought I'd be doing, but in the end everyone was incredibly unwelcoming and I was fired for needing some extra patience and support. I'm back at square one and I don't know what to do now.",2

It's been getting worse for me these recent years. I would get really dizzy and throw up. I actually feel like there's not enough blood flowing through my head, because it feels so empty in there (don't mind my expression lol) and it affects my balance.

"Wife's brain tumour I've been married to my wife for 19 years, we have 2 children, however we do not get on. My wife is rather volatile, and will erupt at me or the children for small things, screaming and shouting. She isn't a bad person, but cannot control her emotions at all. To be honest, she makes my life a misery, and in hindsight we should never have got married - but then again we have had two wonderful kids, who I love with all my heart, so I could never wish for that.

Yesterday my wife returned from a medical appointment - she has been having migraine headaches recently almost constantly, so had been referred to have an MRI of her brain. The results were in, and the doctors have found ""a mass which is concerning"", and want to bring her followup appointment forward.

My first reaction when she told me this was a thrill of excitement that she might die, and I might be rid of her. I feel terrible for thinking such a thing, but I undeniably thought it.

"Driving your OCD Crazy Hello reddit,

One of my closest friends is currently facing a week long ban from FB for using bad language. I have playing a joke on him, by posting gifs to drive his OCD crazy. However, I am quickly running out of material by day 2. So I turn to you guys to help me find links that will really drive him mad, especially considering that he cannot reply to any of them.

I need your help, I need more gifs that drive OCD people crazy.

"Just want to know Im not alone. Anyone else have OCD checking around numbers? I haven't been officially diagnosed by a professional but I feel pretty confident that I have OCD. Since middle school I would force myself to constantly flick lights a certain number of times, or turn the tap on and off 3 times, or scribble with my pencil and erase 4 times before solving a math problem. Now that I have a job that deals with numbers Ive noticed how much OCD holds me back and wastes my time. I constantly have to check and reassure myself that the numbers I typed are correct and reread up to 8 times. I feel like Im going crazy sometimes. On a good note today wasn't that bad and I managed to fight off some compulsions. I was just wondering if theres anyone out there whos dealing with the same thing.",2
"I think I’ve discovered the cause of my reading difficulties: Reading OCD I’ll get right to the point instead of giving you the story like I was about to: if you’ve exhibited symptoms of or been diagnosed with [Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354432) and have difficulty reading, OCD might be the cause. I am not a medical professional, but just found some blog posts that describe what I have been struggling with. Have any of you had similar issues?

Here’s one of the posts I found that describes what I’ve experienced:

Wish me luck on this journey",2
"A few year back I saw the first person suffering from OCD I'd ever seen, and it was terrifying and tragic. I was living in an apartment block with a string of small restaurants beside it. One of the cooks used to park his car under my balcony. Over the course of a few months, as I would be out smoking on the balcony, I would watch this guy park his car if he happened to be there that evening at the same time that I was smoking. He would get out of the car and close the door. Then he would repeat the action five times. Opening and closing the door. Then lock the car with the remote and check to make sure the door was locked by pulling on the handle, again five times, slowly and deliberatly. He would walk away, take a few steps, stop and come back and check five times. It took the poor guy about three or four attempts to leave his car each time. He really looked tormented and I felt so sorry for him. It's the only time I've ever seen someone with OCD like this.",2

"Anyone else have borderline OCD friends and family and have been getting lots of lessons on proper hand washing lately? I hope this isn't considered too serious, because I totally mean it to be light-hearted.  My partner is OCD about a few things (luckily for him its intermittent and generally controllable), and the coronavirus has got him worried.  So I am getting multiple daily lessons about how and when to wash my hands and use hand sanitizer. lol  

This kind of thing used to make me crazy but now that we are old its just funny.  I ask him follow up questions like, ""How much soap per wash would you recommend?"" and ""Do I have to wash after I touch car doors, or just the doors on buildings?""  And he can't stop himself from answering seriously no matter how much I am laughing.  Then when I am done laughing he has to say all over again until I promise to take him seriously.  I wish I knew this technique when I was young, it would have saved a lot of family fighting.",2
My parents have done a lot of things that I heard narcissistic parents do but I’m not sure if it’s just be being a teen So I am a 17M and both my parents are usually really nice and do care about me but sometimes they do things that I just don’t think is right. I have OCD and the know and say they are just trying to help me but when I do something even if it’s only once more than I need to my dad says “ just go” or something like that. I’ll just stop there in case it’s just teenage me bc that probably means my other stuff I have to say is too,2
"I'm in my 30s and I think I just saw the first proper case of OCD Getting on to a plane and this kid would walk up to random people and check that all their bags' zippers are fully closed, lean over seated passengers to fully open windows, and very deliberately line up his feet when crossing markers on the floor.


Parents were very apologetic by they never attempted to stop him, it seems like letting him do his thing is much easier than trying to stop it.


Poor kid. Mental illness sucks.",2
"Been having some intrusive thoughts lately I have OCD, which means if I do something wrong, my mind will bother me about it until it is resolved. But sometimes, my mind just slips off the rails on its own and I think about the most distressing and uncomfortable things. These thoughts, as a recent example, usually replace the faces of who I have personal/intimate attachment to with faces of those Im uncomfortable doing it to, like my grandparents. I do have medicine but due to me being preoccupied by keeping my mind stimulated like listening to music or playing games, it's hard for me to even keep a good routine. Keeping myself stimulated with these things helps me get high off of happiness and usually I get carried away.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys. Feel free to ask questions or give some tips to help me out with this.",2
"For the first time ever last night I managed to stop myself having a seizure after having a panic attack! For context: I struggle with, depression, anxiety, OCD, I’m epileptic and have frequent seizures. Yeah it’s a struggle but one that I live with.

I can feel when I may have a seizure and panic attacks usually ensue whenever I get this feeling (due to past negative experiences). Last night, for the first time EVER I managed to calm myself from the panic attack and come out seizure free 😎 
I know this probably means nothing to the very large majority of you but I was so proud of myself that I had to share! 

It’s a small step for me but it’s something I am very proud of :)",2
"Am I right to feel angry? Everyone knows how seriously I take all the precautions when it comes to Covid. I have OCD, so that has made it worse. I’ve missed out on so much this year because of that, but I’d rather be safe until it’s over. Now that it’s holiday season, my relatives are trying to get together. I’ve told them I’d rather not because of Covid a couple times before, which made things a little awkward. I didn’t wanna offend them, but they know I don’t want to, right? I’ve made it clear. But now they made it so either my family goes to see them or they’ll come to see us. It makes me so angry. Am I wrong? I think I might be. It’s just they don’t even wear a face mask half the time when meeting people. I don’t wanna endanger myself after missing out on so much. I can’t tell",2
"Had a bad Christmas — basement flooded I was actually having a great Christmas Day until the evening when we realized our basement had several inches of water in it. We spent the next several hours hauling things out of the gross water. Some sentimental things were damaged. I have a bit of OCD, and everything feels contaminated now. We tracked poopy water over most of the downstairs. We didn’t get to eat Christmas dinner, and in fact I didn’t eat dinner at all. I only had two meals yesterday and I’m so hungry. I have health issues that mean I need to eat a lot, so missing a meal is a big deal (ha that rhymes). I only got 6 hours of sleep last night and now I’m just lying in bed, hungry but scared to go downstairs because everything down there is dirty. 

Did anyone else’s Christmas take a turn for the worse? Sometimes I feel like I’m living in a series of unfortunate events. Bad stuff has happened in my family the past few winters. Is winter just a  cursed season?",2
"How do you think the pandemic is going to affect young children's attitudes about life going forward? I was thinking if I was a young kid having to isolate for a year or at least having interactions reduced and being told that you have to wipe everything down and be careful around people who aren't wearing masks, etc. that might cause me to be really cautious around people. I wonder if this happens in a key developmental part of someone's life how that shapes the way they feel about such things in the future even as adults. My guess would be that this makes the next generations a little less social at least in person, maybe slightly more autistic-like in terms of societal behaviors and OCD-like about cleaning. What are your thoughts on this?",0
"Most medical profesionals recommend washing your hands after you're done handling any pet dogs or cats. Do you? Personally I do, although I've been fighting OCD for over a decade so my habits are far from ""normal"", pets tend to leave a residue on my hands that I'm unable to ignore. Mainly I'm asking because it's something that comes up very frequently in guides on basic hygiene. How about you?",2
"What's one thing people irl don't know about you? Mine's OCD. Even typing it out seems intimidating to me. Sometimes, it feels like I'm living a double life. I look a certain way to people, when in fact I'm not as tough or a know it all. What about you?",2
"I hate my OCD So, recently I started getting into wearing my prescription glasses outside of when I have to (i.e driving and meetings where I sit far/school lectures) to now using them all day at work ( I stare at a computer screen all day so got blue light) and I realized that either my face is crooked or every pair of glasses either bugs me on my bridge and it seriously gives me anxiety to the point where I can’t breathe or am struggling to breathe.

I’ve been three times to get them adjusted/ tried 2 different companies and frames and it’s probably all in my head since I’m still waiting for a job offer, and idk just a lot of anxiety is making this a bigger deal than it has to be. I feel stupid even putting this out there, but felt like I had to get it off my chest.

I wish I could just let go of my OCD, how do you all cope with small OCD problems?",2
"No one has ever said ""Im here for you if you need to talk"" to me before today I have an operation coming up that i am really nervous for, and i was talking to my lab partner about it. She could tell i was visibly distressed and instead of asking whats wrong or being annoyed, she looked me in the eye and said ""if you ever need to talk, orneed a friend, i am here for you.""

I cried, alot. Made me very happy to hear that from someone i look up to.

Noone has said that to me before and i hadnt noticed until she did, i really hope we can form a close friendship as she understands what it is like to live with anxiety and OCD.

Tl:Dr  someone said something very normal, i noticed i had never heard it before, it made me cry out of happiness and joy.",0
"Anyone else cares about the last thing they ate, last word they said, last Youtube video they watched etc. this year? Happens to me every year. It's not really OCD but it feels like it anyway. I have to say a specific predetermined word as my last word this year and a specific word as the first word next year. Can anyone else relate? Also, happy new year, everyone!",1
"I almost beat OCD! Many people think OCD is wanting everything tidy and clean, but that's not the only obsession. I had panic disorder since I was 10, and when I developed OCD of course the obsession had to be about something that was happening to me during panic attacks, aka it was that I'll stop breathing. I was conscious about my breathing all the time and anxious because of it, all thanks to OCD. I couldn't even go out of my room in fear I'll scare people by screaming in fear of stopping to breathe. A year ago, I started therapy for OCD and depression, and of course panic disorder (still need to beat it and depression but I think I'm getting close!) And yesterday a miracle happened. I managed to not be anxious all day!!!!! Today was like this too, and I'm so so happy right now! I hope it'll be like that for a long time. Thank you guys for reading this to the end, I just had to share the happy news ^^",2
"Anyone overthink about a mental illness and then start getting symptoms? I've got moderate anxiety. But when I read up about other mental health conditions, like OCD, suicidal thoughts, GAD, exam anxiety, I overthink about it to the point where I actually seem to develop the symptoms. But I just try to let that phase pass. But at times, the symptoms stick with me. Like, I've got an exam anxiety thing now. Being a student, that's frustrating. But I know how to handle it, I think.

Anyone else seem to experience this? It seems impossible to make up weird scenarios in your head, I don't know why. Especially when it comes to mental health stuff.",0
"Anyone else likes being in quarantine? I can just stay home, play video games and browse the internet. I don't have to meet anybody (and honestly I don't really want to either). This is the first time in a while that I genuinely feel like I'm resting and relaxing. It's just much less pressure. I still have things that bother me (I've been dealing with OCD which is hard) but I feel pretty good most of the time. People say that this is a really hard time for everyone but honestly I feel good, better than usual. Next week school comes back (physically, not learning from home) and I'm not looking forward to that.

"I'm such a Disney nerd. I'm completely obsessed with all things Disney, have been since I was old enough to form memories. The parks are my favorite places to go, the movies are my favorite things to watch, and the music brings me to tears. I know SO MUCH useless Disney trivia. Only problem is I have nobody to really be Disney obsessed around. I talk to my mom a reasonable amount regarding our shared love of Disney, and we go to Disney World together, but I feel I annoy her quite often. I'm OCD and Bipolar, so I hyper fixate, and I'm severely depressed so very few things have ever made me feel actual happiness. I guess I'm just reaching out to see if maybe someone else out there is just as fixated as me and wouldn't get bored talking to me about what makes me truly happy. This is probably a stretch but I'm incredibly lonely and I feel like such a burden to everyone in my life, I just want someone to bother who won't get tired of talking about the same subject.",2
"Y'all ever like a post or comment solely to make it even? Like, 599 to 600? Even if you don't care much for the comment.

I wonder how many other people do this.

Or maybe it's an OCD thing. I just have to click to make it even, can't resist.

Edit/note: guys I should add that I actually have ocd and do this because of it. I don't mean to make ocd lighthearted or anything. Yes, it is satisfying to watch the 99-->00 but I also am uneasy if I don't do it so that's why I believe it's an ocd driven behavior. ok anyway.. 😂

Edit, pârte dós: Oh and I never dislike to bring it down and make it even. Like from 601 to 600. I don't find that satisfying at all!",2

"Have you ever wondered if your parent is on the autistic spectrum? I have a dad that I have suspected being on the spectrum for a long time due to severe OCD, instant personality change, lack of self-awareness and lack of understanding others' feelings. Some people connect the last trait to just being the dad of the family, but I see it as a possible trait of being on the spectrum. 

It would make sense as I am also on the spectrum, and it is genetically transferable. He doesn't want to get diagnosed, but I am certain to a degree that it is the case. 

Just wanted to be certain that I'm not the only person thinking that of my parents, so have any of you ever wondered this is the case with your parents?",2
"I love doing the dishes. Man idk what it is about it, but at the end of the day, I love it as a stress relieving activity, especially with headphones on and my favourite songs playing. Maybe I love it more because of my OCD too, it make me feel like I've restored some 'order' amongst the mess somehow xD. The feeling of seeing a dirty dish get all pristine and clean is so satisfying too. Especially during this lockdown,when I'm stuck all alone, it helps me keep distracted and a more welcome chore especially during this time.",2
"A diagnosis changed my life. I was finally officially diagnosed with OCD last week after years of feeling not understood, not understanding my compulsions or needs.

"What are you doing during quarantine to make yourself motivated, or what do you have to look forward to? Hi all! Hope everyone is safe and well.
I’m going through a patch of quarantine blues, it could be PMS coupled with the fact that I’m probably not getting a bunch of serotonin because I’m not around friends or going out or anything, and I’m generally in my home or neighborhood. The last couple days I have felt a general “bleh”-ness and haven’t felt super interested or motivated to do things I normally enjoy doing.

What do you all do to motivate yourself, find hopeful moments, or find (little) things to look forward to during quarantine/self isolation? 
Do you have any tips for feeling excited, or at least interested again?

Note: I am diagnosed OCD but have no history of depression. Everyone has moments, and the quarantine is just bringing blues out. I just want practical tips on how to feel better from the good people of reddit!

Take care of yourselves.",2
"It makes me uncomfortable to hear my own name I don't like hearing my name out loud. I don't like saying it, and when I hear someone else say it I get this weird uncomfortable ""tingle."" It's not that I have any problem with my name. I don't have any conscious aversion to it. I like it just fine. I've been diagnosed with OCD, I wonder if that's somehow part of it. Does anyone else experience this?",2
"Does anybody else have a habit of biting the skin on the inside of your lips/cheeks? I can’t stand this damn habit. What’s funny is I remember the exact day it started, I saw some girl doing it in middle school, asked her what she was doing, like a dumb kid I tried it and here I am a grown man in my early 30s still doing it. My life is good and I’m not OCD about anything but this. I’ll do it constantly sometimes, and it’s so hard to stop if there’s uneven spots. 


Anybody else out there relate?",1
"I'm getting back into therapy My job gives us 6 free sessions with a therapist and sources for therapy connections. It's been years and I've never gotten anywhere with professionals on my traumas and behaviors. My boyfriend's been lovingly nudging me to see a professional for help and for my benefit and his benefit and for the comfort I deserve, i finally decided it's time to surrender to treatment options. I can't do it alone and that's ok, in fact, two heads are better than one, right? So I think I finally found a therapist that could work for.my schedule, finincial situation, and it's close by so travel won't be a pain, either. 
I think I have OCD. I have a dependence on some drugs from self medication. My life is a mess. I'm anxious more often than not. I'm ""ok"" but for me and my love, I have decided to go from ""ok"" to great. I'm really excited and scared to seek treatment. I feel ill and sad, but relieved and happy.

"What is the next aspect of the classic introvert's lifestyle that will be made mainstream by the world? When I was a kid if you told me in the year 2020 comic books would be widely popular and they'd be making movies out of every single one, that I'd have access to more video games than I had time to play, that my OCD and paranoia of other people would be the norm in order to survive, that I would rarely ever have to make eye contact with people or even see them in person anymore, I would have screamed and peed myself because time travel frightens me.

"How to not affiliate bad luck with my belongings when something bad happens? As the title implies, I have a bad habit of deeming things as causing bad luck when I wear them or use them and something bad happens. I have diagnosed OCD and I know it probably has to do with that. Things I mentally deem as unlucky are makeup, clothing, hair ties, pens, notebooks, books, bags/purses, etc. This habit has caused me to not use items I spent lots of money on. I have even donated items that I considered unlucky because I couldn't bring myself to wear them anymore. I am really struggling with this problem, does anyone have any tips? Thank you.",2
"My cat is... Really tidy. Almost OCD tidy. She wants to all the stuff in the house be exactly where she wants it.
 I on the other hand like everything to be casual, don't fret to much. She  works all night. She's is also peculiar about floor. So dishwashing sponge and cloth must be on the floor. She also likes table to be uncluttered. She wakes me up in the morning and looks at me like- ""isn't this much better, don't you agree, Im so tired of doing everything myself, can we just find common ground, I'm really tired, don't l deserve some snack and respite? "" 
She's also a tech-wizz. Constantly trying to teach me new shortcuts on keyboard and stuff, but she's way above my league. Too fast! She looks at me sometimes like I am simpleton.
Do you have a cat?

"I really like doing domestic chores Just casually wondering if anyone feels the same. I like cooking, cleaning, doing laundry and all that stuff. I have been this way ever since I was young. My parents never needed to tell me to clean my room, and I even helped them tidy up their rooms as well as other parts of the house. I am currently living with a roommate who is on the messy side, but I help her with all her things too if I have the time. I often cook for her as well, and she would comment that I have that ""mother"" vibe. I do not have OCD or anything, just that doing these chores makes me feel really happy and relaxed. Does anybody have the same hobby?",1
"Can't play video games or watch TV unless it's dark I've been having a weird issue for some time now, where I can't play video games during the day, it feels so wrong that whenever I try it feels like i should save it for the evening.

It almost feels like an OCD thing

Do anybody else experience this, or something similar?",1
"Social Media Detox So recently when I get on to any kind of social media I just feel kind of meh about it. I don't really get any joy out of certain apps anymore, generally because there's nothing to look at or do. So I've decided I'm going to slowly start removing my social media apps and try to become less dependent on my technology. The only apps I'm keeping are the ones that I still enjoy using (primarily Instagram and Reddit). I deleted my pinterest app a few weeks ago, and yesterday I deleted my snapchat. Next up I'm thinking twitter, and maybe eventually Facebook. It's really weird not having them on my phone anymore but I like that it decreases my OCD to look at my phone any second I'm not busy with other things. 

Anyone else ever do a social media detox? If so, how did you do it and how did you feel after?",2
"After 20 years, I finally feel comfortable in my own mind and body Too much in a rush to explain my life story, but basically I am content with life :) After a life of depression, anxiety, and years of OCD/PTSD, I finally am comfortable with living.

"Does anyone else just not really have a strong reaction to music anymore lately? Most of the time music bores me out of my mind (it doesn't matter what kind of music, whether it's ambient, grindcore, or acoustic blues), or makes me feel bad, some songs are good, but what's disappointing is that the songs I simply find good are the songs I thought were totally amazing a while ago. What's really annoying though, is that even if I don't like it, I keep playing music because it's some sort of OCD or muscle memory at this point.

I think it's just a music thing, because I'm getting more into gaming again, and it's way more fun to me at the moment. Do you guys have this, too? What do you do about it?",0
"Any tips for helping Charlie? Charlie, a poor older man in my city is really feeling down lately (no longer has wife or kids). Any tips or ideas to boost his esteem and cheer him up. Just looking for some simple suggestions to help out a chap in need.

"DAE get compulsive thoughts randomly? When I was little I believe I legitimately had OCD, but I didn't tell anyone and didn't know it was a relatively common disorder. I eventually grew out of it, but sometimes I still get compulsive thoughts.

Its usually just thinking of myself doing something terrible to a friend/family member/pet, but things I'd never do. Like start yelling at them or just haul off and hit them for no reason. It doesn't really affect my everyday life, but sometimes some of the thoughts are more bothering than others. Anybody else get this type of thing?",2

"Confidence For some background, I'm an engineering student. I'm in my Junior year of college. I was homeschooled from preschool to graduation. I have OCD, formally diagnosed a couple of years ago. 

I constantly feel like I can't do anything right. I don't really have a good reason to feel that way, I guess. My GPA is 3.8 and I don't know that anyone hates me. No matter what I do, though, I feel like everyone is just tolerating me to avoid hurting my feelings. Any time I work on a project, I feel like there's some crucial piece of information that everyone else knows and I somehow missed. It keeps me from talking about my ideas or asking for help, which just makes the problem worse. It's like the unholy lovechild of social anxiety and imposter syndrome. 

Have any of you dealt with this? Do you have any advice? I'm trying to get an internship right now and it's making it very difficult.",2
"Having a bad day... I kept making mistakes at my internship and I just feel like giving up. Plus I have OCD, an anxiety disorder and depression, so I don't know how I'll even get through the rest of the internship. I feel so down and horrible about myself. I made the dumbest mistake when trying to arrange for someone to take a class at the writing school I work at and made a mistake with the money. Plus this girl I work with has an amazing memory and mine is shot from the meds i'm on. Don't know what to do. :/",2
"A question on confidence... I've been playing tennis since I was in grade 6 (I'm 15 now). Lately I haven't been feeling on top of my game. I'm not confident when I serve or hit my shots so my once accurate and hard shots are now creek puff hits that go out a lot. I have anxiety and OCD so that might be an issue. Anyway, my questions for you guys are:
- Have you ever experienced something like this?
- Do you have any advice?
- What sport do you play?",2

Tell me I am not alone. Tell me some odd things you do. Maybe give some closure and suggest reasons behind my madness. ",2

"Dbrand Skin Reccomendations Hi guys, just took a ugly case of my macbook pro 15"". I had that case since i got my computer so finally taking it off (except for cleaning) and actually using it without a case on feels so wonderful and nice, and the machine looks so beautiful!

I don't want to put a case on ever again. However, i was considering to FINALLY buy something from dbrand.

What color/skin should I get? I was considering carbon fiber?

Are you satisfied with your skin?

Does the track-pad skin feel weird?

"Positive experiences with antidepressants? Hey there, so I have been thinking about getting help lately for my OCD/Depression because I can't keep living how I currently am. A major problem is that as a byproduct of my OCD, I have a terrible fear/avoidance of medicine and drugs. I see a ton of negative talk on the internet and in every day life of the detrimental effects antidepressants can have on you, and the scary side effects of the meds. I would love to hear any **positive** stories with those that have used antidepressants to combat depression. Thanks in advance to anyone who decides to share their experience! ",2

You need to learn what it means and what it does to a person before talking about it. I don’t know where people started believing it’s just wanting everything neat, and everything perfect, because only a small percentage of people with OCD actually have those symptoms. 

Please, take a few minutes to do a bit of research on what OCD is before claiming to have it. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.",2

Some people go for coffee or an energy drink but nothing gets your blood pumping like a voice coming out of your mouth that’s not your own. Seriously though stop saying you have OCD because you like cleaning your room or that you have ADHD because you can’t focus on homework. As someone who has to deal with both on a daily basis it really pisses me off to see people fake it here for karma. I’m leaving this godforsaken hellhole and I implore everyone else to do the same.

"Okay, some people need to learn what OCD is. OCD is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. A lot of people think that ""Oh, I need to take each note in a different color pen because I have OCD."" or ""I need this to be perfect, it's my OCD"". This isn't what OCD is. An example of OCD is where people have to wash their hands 5 times before leaving the house. Another example is they have to touch everything in their backpack when getting ready for school. OCD is not when you need everything to be perfect. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-T19wbcEA4) a video that's good on showing what OCD actually is.",1

"A rant about self-diagnosing OCDs and not doing enough research. I hate it when someone sees something unorganized and is like ""ooohhhh my OCD"".
I'm guessing those people don't know what an OCD is. 
OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder,  not wanting to organize things. 
Having the want to organize things is a personality trait, not a disorder.
I also hate it when people assume that all OCDs are organization based. That is completely wrong. 
I have Trichotillomania, which is an OCD that makes me pull out my eyelashes. I went to counseling, and it went away. 
8 months later, one of my classmates says something about OCDs. I respond with 
""I used to have an OCD. "" She was then confused and said that you can't get over OCDs. Guess what? I got my OCD back. 
Please don't self diagnose yourself with something you know nothing about.

It isn’t “cute” or “quirky” it is downright fucked up to do that when there are actually real people who have these mental disorders. I think it is very disrespectful to people who have actual mental illness. All I’m saying is that it is fucked and needs to stop!,1

If I stub my toe on a wall, I’ve got to stub the toe on the other foot.

If I mumble something, I’ve got to say it twice.

I have to point objects on tables away from living things, I have to place coffee cups with the handle facing backwards

I have to turn lights off in a certain order.

Not only are my current obsessions and compulsions ever-present, but I am developing new ones. Additionally, I am experiencing auditory hallucinations.

"OCD or obsessive personality or just organized? I’ve been pondering this for a while and am looking for y’all’s two cents. 

My therapist ran me through the DSM5 for a handful of disorders and while I definitely have severe anxiety the other things felt inconclusive. For OCD I checked enough boxes but I really don’t have any physical compulsions so i’m not sure. I have obsessive thoughts but none relating directly to actions; i clean my room the calm my anxious obsessive thoughts rather than to satisfy a compulsion. 

If I do not keep my exact routine, or try to change it sometimes, my life comes crashing down. The slightest amount of clutter makes me so anxious. This has been a major problem in my life.

I don’t know if i’m just really organized, if I do have OCD, if I have an obsessive personality, or it’s just anxiety that doesn’t quite classify as OCD.

Or say you are going about your week and someone signs you up for something that ultimately benefits you, yet you become extremely anxious. For me I can have an entirely unplanned and messy week up ahead but if I am randomly scheduled out of the blue for something whether it's that day or a tiny work shift in 3 days I become overwhelmingly anxious, scared and upset.

Just wondering if anyone has any helpful advice or anything I can try to do to get me through the next few days while I wait for my next therapy session.

Thanks all.",2
"Poem/Rap about OCD I might look like a lazy bum, to fucking some 

but really I slaved at allot of jobs, and only but for a fucking crum 

Yeah like yum, I tried more then twice 

I’m so poor, I can’t even buy me rice 

Im so poor, that’s for sure, I can’t even buy a rag to mop the mother fucking floor 

I have, they call, OCD, everyday it affects me 

It’s not fun, can’t you see? It’s not easy as can be 

Wish OCD, it would flee 

And leave me mother fucking be 

people can assume what they want, people might assume it’s not that bad, but it’s bad 

I’m unwilling to work? No I’m really fucking not.

“Why are you not working then? “You lazy bum. you should starve until you rot.”

Yeah maybe I should, but maybe i would work, if I fucking could jerk 

dealt with bullies at last job, maybe I should rob, or maybe instead I will only rip a shirt.",2
"OCD/depression I’m not gonna lie, I hate living. There’s no point in it anymore for me. I don’t have a purpose, college doesn’t really feel like it’s gonna work out for me, and high school was nothing but misery. I keep obsessing over small things that keep fucking up my ability to perform well. I just don’t see the point of trying. 

I’ve really tried my best but nothing extraordinarily good has happened to me. Everything fucking sucks and everyone leaves. I’m talking to a girl but my family will outcast me if I tell them and I’m still living with them (don’t have enough money to move out). 

I lost someone I really loved and I’m pretty sure they’re out of my life forever and I don’t even know why. 

I just don’t see a purpose anymore. I’m not mentally stable, I have no talent, I’m not smart. I’m just really vulnerable, an addict, and fucked in the head. 

Trying hasn’t done anything for me and I wish I pulled through with my previous attempts years back",2
"Question about OCD So my OCD began affecting me back in March of 2020 once lockdown began. I began having mainly sexual intrusive thoughts. During this time I would cope by listing to my favorite artist, Juice WRLD. Basically, when I play the songs I was listening to during that time, I begin to remember and it makes me depressed and anxious. Does anyone else experience this and does it have a medical name or something along those lines?",2

Does anyone have any advice?",1
"Therapist Doesn't Think I Should Try ERP/ACT For My OCD I have seen my therapist for many years now, and she is general CBT, who  has treated OCD patients in the past. Our meetings comprise talk  therapy, and I do think it helps to some degree, but I have now  mentioned ERP several times to her, specifically imaginal exposure  scripting, and she thinks it's a bad idea. She thinks it will only send  me deeper into a spiral for my mostly real-event OCD. Does this sound  strange or concerning to anyone?",2
"Difference between rumination in depression and OCD? I've been wondering what the difference between rumintations in depression and OCD are.

I've been diagnosed with Depression and I suspect I have OCD, but I'm not sure whether I should bring it up with my therapist because I've read that people with depression can also experience rumination. 

Does anyone maybe experience both Depression and OCD and can give some insight? Or if you just have one of them describe what ruminations are like for you, like the topics and the feelings that acompany it (anxiety, sadness, etc.)? Thanks!",2

"OCD & relationship Recently my girlfriend of 2 years and I broke up. To summarize, we still have lots of feelings for each other but we can’t seem to find ways to make the relationship work. Essentially, she battles with OCD, this makes her believe she did things that she did not actually do and her mind convinces her of it. For her, her mind makes her be convinced that she cheats on me. For reassurance, she has to tell me what she did. The problem is I’ve found 2 extremities. For one i don’t want to lie to her and tell her I believe she has done what she thinks she has done.  On the other hand I find it impossible for me to be able to just accept being cheated on as she wants me too. If anyone has any suggestions or ways to help that would be great.",2
"OCD and owning pets//looking for advice 
I’ve been struggling really badly recently with feeling “dirty” and washing my hands and showering and changing too much etc. 
i foster cats and i started it to bring me comfort but I think at this moment in time it’s bringing me more distress than comfort. I’ve been really struggling with feeling gross after I clean the litter box (three times a day for one cat) and every time after i change and shower and vacuum and the idea of cats right now is making me anxious since they step in their litter box. 

Do you think i should fight the urge to tell the shelter I need a break from fostering or do you think it would be better for my mental health to push through my flare up right now?",2
"Harm OCD sufferer I’m ashamed of the constant thoughts I have rummaging through my head.  It’s to the point that I can’t even own a gun, I have to have my firearm unloaded and the bullets out of the magazine because I’m afraid I will unconsciously fall into some trance and harm myself or someone with them.  I know it’s wrong, But I’ve never had these thoughts before.  This started about 6 weeks ago.  Please can anyone offers some support to me, how can I beat this?  How have other sufferers beat this?  Please I’m desperate.  I’ve gonna see a therapist in April when my insurance kicks in.  I need reassurance...",2
"Anyone else with OCD have bad memories of having compulsions around people who didn't understand? I have a specific memory from elementary school where I kept asking my art teacher if I was missing something for a project, because I felt like I had to check over and over, and he started yelling at me from being frustrated. There are also times where I've checked things like a light switch or wall plug over and over while with someone else, and they would ask me what was wrong with me. It's really embarrassing.",2
"My friends are telling me it’s OCD but it doesn’t feel like it Whenever I see a triple number (eg. 333) I have to tap myself however many times the number represents (for last eg, I’d have to tap 3 times).    
If I don’t do it, I’ll think about it constantly until I tap myself.    
The form of tapping isn’t important, as long as my hand touches some point on my body. Any numbers apply, and if it’s say 3333, I’d have to tap myself 6 times, because there technically two sets of triple three if you break it up.    
As you can imagine, when I see a repeating/same number of like 8 digits long, I can get distracted for a long time while I’m trying to count the sets of 3.     
I hope this makes sense. Could it be OCD? All my friends say it is, but they’re not doctors. I want to know if this is something that can be fixed...",1

The hypnotist my father took me to, before seeing the doctor said it's depression.

So many medicines, so much money , so much time and I still feel that I went nowhere. Maybe I just got better at hiding it.

If a thought pops into my mind for example “where’s my birth certificate” I have to find it before I can move onto anything else because if I don’t find it I won’t stop thinking about it or searching for it until I find it. It can be anything even something that I don’t need especially at that exact moment. It’s the same with if I think of a random question, it literally could be any question like “who was the first president of the United States” and I have to look it up immediately or I’ll literally only think about that random question until I find it out.

I am a person interested in creativity and recently/aka for an entire month I've been having obsessive religious thoughts about whether or not the magic shown in fiction is bad/would be a sin in that universe, etc. As someone who writes music and designs clothes this also gets in the way of my creative process and makes me feel as though anything creative that has to do with magic is bad. It's so bad that it's all I think about from the time I wake up until I go to sleep.

But since some years, whenever I'm actually invested in a TV show, I start having thoughts like if I keep watching this show, I cannot grow in my career again and again.

Sometimes, I start having thoughts I don't want to grow in career because I can not keep on living in fear throughout my life. I'm feeling I'm losing my mind? Is this OCD because I haven't seen anyone having this issue?",1
I know I have OCD but my dad doesn't believe me. This is proof. I sleep with about 15 stuffed animals in my bed and I arrange them so I can sleep facing all of them otherwise the ones I turn my back on will be sad and they will wake up in the night and throw the other ones off the bed. Also I can't step on sidewalk cracks or lava will come out of them and if I sleep with the door open my house will get robbed. I know these are all very irrational fears but I can't not do those things.,2

"Developed severe OCD as a result of the quarantine As the title states. I have been prone to intrusive thoughts, anxiety, depression my whole life. But never OCD in which I was performing rituals. This has only come about recently. Began the first few months into the quarantine and has gotten progressively worse to the point where it’s debilitating. I think all the time I’ve spent alone and in my house, the lack of social interaction, etc. throughout the quarantine has made my mind go to weird places and yeah I’ve developed this severe OCD.

I also get the same feeling in the back of my neck if a pile of books isn't straight and neat, or if a list of names on paper aren't straight and in line. And if I see someone touch something awkwardly or touch something just outside the middle of their palm in a video I get the feeling.

1) Do I have the tolerance to keep ignoring them long term

2) What should I do if they become intense and I don’t have the ability to think about anything else

It feels almost like suppressing this evil inside my head and I feel so guilty for even fantasizing of murdering or other extremities.

"Is This Relationship OCD? Hi, so my girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months and recently we hit pretty rough patch. After some self-reflection and research, she feels like she has OCD.

She talks about how she feels that if she doesn't do certain stuff correctly that bad events will happen from it. For example, if she doesn't shower a certain way, or put food in the fridge a specific way, her mind tells her that we're going to break up. She also goes into cycles of asking herself ""Do I really love him as much as he loves me?"" or ""How can he say he loves me so much if I don't have anything to give?"". Is this mindset possibly arising from undiagnosed OCD that she may have?",1
"OCD is hard to overcome It is so hard to overcome OCD for me the fear of no do the compulsions is a hard thing to do but I know that I can do it and that you can do it the person that is reading this and is going through something like this to, but that is all I have to say have a great day.",2
How do you differentiate the symptoms of autism and OCD in a person that has both? How do I know what causes my intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors this time? Is there a cheatsheet for this?,1
"Can OCD make things seem voluntary? Hello. I am grappling with this question but I can’t seem to find much info about it. So basically, I was on Wikipedia, and I hovered over an article and my brain goes “There will be a naked baby there”, so I look and there is nothing. Problem is, it felt completely voluntary and I’ve been feeling awful ever since. Does this happen to anyone else?",1

I really cannot explain why but getting that diagnosis was such an incredible self knowledge moment.  What I am experiencing and how I am behaving is very normal for people in traumatic incidents.  I am not crazy!!!  There is treatment and hope to help me and I do  not have to do it alone.  I do not just have to get over it, and constantly disappoint myself.

Honestly I am a little euphoric right now.  Glad to have a place to share!",2

I am picking up my belongings from the group HQ today after getting one of those “opportunity to quit before getting fired” messages late last night.

A bit of a background: potential employer is an affiliate of the company I worked about 3 years ago.

Months after I quit and in my new job, I actually had to go through counseling as I have acquired PTSD on the previous job haha

Now I got an opportunity to apply to an affiliate, with better pay, but as soon as I received an email from them and saw the affiliate logo (same as the previous one) and email address, I felt uneasy like having someone lowkey punch me in the stomach.

I want the full normal horror movie build up, but as they build tension into the final showdown, the protagonist just looses his/her collective shit. I want a Watchmen style Rorschach moment when the evil guy realizes that the protagonist isn't stuck with them, they are stuck with the protagonist.

I just imagine how many people out there are absolutely nuts. I know people who, if you triggered their PTSD like that, would tear you apart and bathe in your blood. Maybe I'm just outside the range of normal, but I'm pretty sure that my reaction to an unwinnable situation where my friends are getting murdered would be to lose any pretense of humanity and flip the f out on whoever is doing it.

What do you guys think? Has anyone seen a movie like that?",1
"I got hit by a car at a crosswalk today. I'm fine, but I'm freaking out slightly.

I also didn't call the cops, but I probably should have.",2
Just walked out of a party without saying anything to anyone because of anxiety So my daughter is on a cheer team and they're always having family get together and stuff. Today was a pool party. I have PTSD and social anxiety and it's devastating to my life. I'm in therapy and take a ton of meds. I always am hopeful that I can open up around these people but once I'm around them it's like I can't talk. I just sit there and watch everyone talk around me. I feel bad for my daughter because she's very social and I hate having to leave because I feel like I'm going to panic. I just feel like I'm in the background always and no one notices me. Anyone else ever feel like this? How do I get over this? I have to spend pretty much every weekend with these people and I don't want to be on the outside forever. ,1
"Reddit makes me happy. We get to see humans being bros every day.  Whether it’s a pizza to a hungry person or a simple comment to brighten someone’s day.  It’s all awesome.

I just did my first trade at r/giftcardexchange and put complete trust in a stranger.  That trade is helping my GF and I keep our internet on this month.  What a wonderful system.

In December, a random stranger from Germany bought our kitty a new harness because he out grew the one he had and we couldn’t afford another.  My GF and I have PTSD.  We take our kitty for walks (we call them sniff sessions, or sniff sesh:) as part of our therapy.  Not being able to walk him was it’s own form of weird torture.  What a wonderful human being.  We took videos of him walking specifically for her, in his new shiny big-boy leash!

We met on Tinder, dated for 10 weeks, and I asked her to make it official yesterday.  I was so nervous haha!

I caught myself thinking of future plans with her, deleting girls from facebook and instagram that had no significance in my life, and realizing that I was myself with her.

Its everyone for themselves here, its been like that since about 60s, 70s, 80s. Anyway, its been scaring my dog so much! She whimpers and pants and hides in the bathroom.

"Dog walks into a bar The bartender asks “What can I get you?” The dog doesn’t say anything, because dogs can’t talk. 

The bartender realizes that trying to have a conversation with a dog is a sign that something might be going wrong with him mentally, so he goes to see a therapist. The therapist diagnoses him with early stage dementia and schizophrenia resulting from a number of factors, in particular the stress from his recent divorce, PTSD from his experiences in the military, and sleep deprivation as a result of an 80-hour work week. 

The therapist recommends that the bartender start taking certain medicine to balance out his mental problems, and also encourages him to ask his boss to lighten his work load, in addition to taking a vacation for a week or so. 

The bartender does these things and starts to experience a positive change in his mental, not to mention physical health. He’s thankful that he was able to take care of these issues before they got out of hand.",2

It turns out that there is no loneliness and sadness like dying before you’re ready. I was screaming and fully convinced I had already died and my remaining consciousness was some form of hell. 

I developed PTSD from this experience I believe. Sometime I can be completely sober and start panicking about whether or not I am truly alive. Ever since that experience I have felt disconnected from others, as though I have been through realities they could never experience.

"Attacked My Wife While Sleepwalking To give some backround, I have PTSD, insomnia, and frequent night terrors.

One thing I have never done, however, is sleepwalk. This changed last night.

Somehow, I lost a complete 24 hours and during that time I walked around naked, tried to drive, yelled/screamed at my wife, and even punched her.

She got all this on video - and she says I wasn't really attacking her. It was more like I was 'punching air'. I was glassy-eyed - and it was as if I didn't even see her or acknowledge her presence Luckily, since I was sleeping my punches were very weak (so she says).

Still, I am haunted by watching video of myself in a trance and haunted y losing 24 hours.

I feel terrible for punching and screaming at my wife.

I still feel terrible.

Table was covered in chocolate milk, I was covered in chocolate milk, it was a scene out of Saving Private Ryan. So my teacher had me take this dirty sponge and clean it all up. My bully started bustin my chops about it, and I had just about enough of him. So I stood up, dirty sponge soaked with chocolate milk in hand, walked right on over to my crush and wrang that thing out right over her head and soaked her.

Currently I'm in psychiatric therapy because I have depressive personality, anxiety, PTSD (due to sexual abuse as a child), and ADD and it should be easy to tell my therapist about this.

"I really want a service dog I was diagnosed with PTSD last September as a result of child abuse and while I mostly believe that I've recovered from it, I still find myself in a few uncomfortable situations. The most common situation is related to elevators which I've become deathly afraid of due to the fact that my biological father would lock me in a closet whenever I refused to obey his ""demands"". I'm finishing up my first week at university and have learned that I have a class on the thirteenth floor.

And I literally want to pass out every time I go up and down said elevator. 

So in short, I suppose that I want a service dog mostly because of my extreme paranoia regarding elevators, the dact that I'm having a slightly difficult time adjusting to university, and that I really miss my dogs back at home.

Problem is that I worry about taking a dog away from someone else who might need it much more than me. Also, I'm a college student which means that I'm automatically poor.

"Anything to help PTSD nightmares? Hey reddit. I've had PTSD for damn near 10 years now, and typically have it under control. Recent events have shaken that pretty hard and my nightmares are getting bad enough that I'm not really sleeping anymore again. This happened before, if not worse, years ago when I was first learning to cope with PTSD. My old tricks are not working. I'm just so tired. Side note, I have chronic pain from endometriosis... when I take narcotic pain killers for that (rarely), it has the added benefit of no nightmares. So I wonder if some kind of anti-anxiety or mild sedative might help me get through it this go round. Unfortunately, I don't have health insurance... so meds might be trickier.",2

I get extremely anxious and think about my own experience and what happened that night. I find it so disturbing.

I'm starting to think I may have some form of PTSD. I don't go to therapy much anymore but I never brought it up to my therapist because I really have never heard of anyone having PTSD from that. I hear of so many things causing PTSD but never suicide attempts. Is it possible? Is it worth bringing up to a therapist?",1

I freeze, shut down, cry, or all of the above. I always thought that those were signs of a trauma disorder, aside from your ""run of the mill"" anxiety.

"My kitten let me pet him for the first time today. We got him 3 weeks ago, he was very shy and would run to hide if anyone entered the room we had prepared for him. I've been reading articles on how to gain the trust of a cat, most adviced to let them be comfortable with your presence and have a routine for feeding times. With time he became more friendly napping in open areas instead of hiding places then slowly becoming curious and approaching us trying to sniff us. Today he just made my day when he came over to where I was sitting and didn't run away when I stroked him. He was abit nervous probably because he has never experienced it before but he started purring after awhile and slept on my lap. It's definitely a start to a great friendship.

"The worst lesson I had to learn at 28 To be honest, I haven’t felt the effects of COVID lockdowns like most people have. I contribute this to being an only child and growing up in a mostly introverted environment. I’ve lived alone since I was 20 and have enjoyed the freedom. However, it’s led me to become very selfish with my time. My family and friends became less of a priority over the years because I wanted to do things that made ME happy. Last week, my aunt and dad’s last living relative, had a massive stroke. The doctors have said she won’t talk or walk again. She also can’t comprehend anything above that of a 5 year old, she doesn’t even recognize her family members. 

In short: make time for your family and friends. Regardless if they get on your nerves, you already have plans or would rather watch Netflix. At 28, I just now realized time is limited with the ones we love.",2

ESPECIALLY THE PAINTINGS? like the brush strokes and blending CAN BE SEEN SO CLEARLY? it’s majestic!! The creativity and beauty that are captured in all of them are like WOW. Like I guess you can go now but I just think it’s different?

"I made my cousin laugh My cousin overdosed and suffered two heart attacks and a stroke this year. The stroke really messed up his motor skills and speech, but each day he’s improving.
Honestly this whole situation has been so very hard for him and all of us. I can’t imagine how it must feel to not be able to communicate and move of your own free will. It’s so heartbreaking.
But yesterday I was finally able to see him. He started crying, I started crying. The whole thing. But after that, I showed him pictures and gifs of one of his favorite characters in Adam Sandler movies, Rob Schnieder. Haha we always told each other “you can do it!” So while I showed him, he was able to smile and even laugh a little bit. 
I hope it helped him. I hope he was able to feel like himself in that regard.

"I just got over my fear of dogs, and I've never loved them so much before. So, my dad decided to adopt a cute white puppy who was very weak (she has lack of pigment, so her nose and paws are pink) and bitten a lot by her family (they're a bunch of stray dogs), and I used to be so scared that I would stay 5 feet away or try to pet them without them licking me.

A few days ago I wanted to know what it feels like to stroke a dog's tail and I decided to mess around with Daisy (the puppy) for a bit. It was fun, so yesterday I decided to try and feed peanut butter to her using my fingers to know what a dog's lick feels like (it was wet but extremely ticklish, so I giggled a lot).

Today I was so brave that I managed to pick up Daisy and feed her some treats! She even sat on my lap for a few moments!

I really felt like telling someone here about this because I have never been so happy around Daisy! :)",1

I was living with other 4 family members, 3 of which were also sick, one trying to revive from several strokes that had fatal consequences, their wife, the most terrible person I've met, my mom, who had a severe undiagnosed kidney problem and my grandmother, recovering from a cancer surgery.
I am the youngest, so I had to deal with all that, not  able to show emotion so things could appear somewhat normal. 

Today I got my blood sample test results and I'm much better, eating healthier than last year, feeling better and happier. Do I like what I see on the mirror?  Not really, but I'm coming to terms with it. However, I want to change that and finally I have the energy and motivation to do so, now that we're all better.

Didn't have anyone to tell this so I thought this would be the right place... Hope you have a great day!",2
"My mum is at the hospital and I don't have anybody to tell So my mum felt sick yesterday evening which was unusual for her. My dad drove her to the doctor and he said she better get it checked up at the hospital. They had to wait some time but it was okay (our healthcare system is great so she got everything she needed). My dad texted me whenever something happened, my siblings didn't know anything since they weren't at home. Because of that I waited with my cat. I went to bed later and my father returned at 1 am which he told me in the morning. The doctors wanted to keep my mum there to do more tests (they thought it could be a sign for a stroke or similar). So she will be staying there until Friday. My dad's currently visiting my mum, so far nothing has been found. It probably isn't a big deal and she will be sent home after this but I wanted to tell someone without sounding like I want much attention because of that. So thanks for reading :)",2
"I have a weird request CC. Quiz me on strokes. Not like swimming strokes, but medical emergency strokes. I have a big interview at work on monday to be a part of a stroke ambulance team and I've decided I need to know anything and everything about them. 

Hit me with questions, statistics, treatment plans, etc, and I'll do the best I can to answer off the top of my head.",1
"I’m 10 weeks and 2 days free of cigarettes and alcohol! I honestly never thought I would make it this far because my addiction to both was just so bad. Like, it was a survival thing.

The sobriety was triggered by a sudden, intense hyperventilation attack that caused the first responders to say that I had the worst facial spasms they had either ever seen or had seen in a while. I felt like I was having a stroke, so that was just it. It was after a massive hangover and I was trying to fight through it, but just couldn’t control my body’s reaction.

So, yeah. I’m pretty proud of myself right now. I don’t really have cravings anymore, but this whole shut down going on in my State has made me wish I could have a drink every once in a while. My improving health has made it an easy decision to not relapse at all.

TL/DR: I’m sober and so much happier and healthier!",2

"Does anyone else not say ""I love you""? Recently, a family member of mine had a stroke. He seems to be improving but needs therapy, in the long run, to get back to a somewhat normal life. My family wanted me to do a video call with them and tell him I love him. My family has known for quite some time that I don't like saying ""I love you"". It's not that I don't feel love or that I don't love them. It's just that, that words carry a lot of emotion and I feel like I should only say it when I really, really feel it and mean it. Yet my family still pesters me on the daily to say ""I love you"" almost like a joke or to guilt-trip me.",1

"It finally downed upon me that I made peace with my brother I had a pretty rough relationship with my older brother for a few years until a few months ago when we made peace, it was a long and hard way and at the end we didn't even talked about it, we just decided to forget everything that happened and be nice to each other.

yesterday we went to my grandpa's birthday and after we left the restaurant my grandma which isn't 100% with us (she had a stroke in 2008 and haven't completely recovered) asked me ""are you and what's his name (points to where my older brother went) are sholem? (an Hebrew phrase kids use to say they aren't fighting anymore)"" and then it downed on me, we are half a year sholem, this whole saga is over, this chapter in my life is close. 

I am so happy we managed to not fight for so long, it's probably the longest it ever been without any major drama (not counting the time I went no contact) and although it may seem small to an outsider it's huge for me",1
"I had a very odd stroke of luck yesterday. I bought a trench coat on mazon for about $100. It was on my doorstep when I got home from work so I took the package inside and opened it. What was inside was a gray jacket when I wanted a tan one. So I called amazon and they sent me a return lable. I looked closer at what I got and realized they had sent me a charcoal gray Michael Kors suit. In exactly my size. I tried it on and it fit perfect!

The strangest part was that I want a charcoal gray suit, but I didn't want to spend the money. Now I get a $600 suit in exactly my size dropped into my lap.",1

"I just turned in my last paper in my undergrad! This last half of my last semester was really rough on me. I was trying to apply for graduate school; finish my bachelor's degrees (double majored in Psychology and Religious Studies); help my grandmother who had a stroke last year; and my mother has been on the brink of a panic attach almost every day due to a combination of work, her PhD program, and helping my grandmother. I got really depressed with the quarantine and stopped participating in my classes since that all moved to online format, but I emailed my professors earlier this week to try to make amends. They told me I could turn in a few things to pass, so I've rushed to get them done and now I'm going to graduate with TWO DEGREES! I'm so excited and I'm honestly pretty proud of myself for pushing my way through all the shit I've had to deal with in these past few years.",1
"How can i talk with people about my interests without being a showoff? My interests never really matched with people. 

In my childhood my parents made me learn different things (musical instruments, different sports, painting etc). 

Whenever someone asks me about my hobbies, i tell things slowly, when they get to know that i can do most of the swimming strokes, can paint, unpublished book of poems, nearly complete novel, play variety of instruments and major being i love physics being a girl (yeah most people find it amusing); they get intimated by all of that. 

At times i even feel bad for knowing stuff, i never go and tell anyone that i know xyz, it eventually just comes up.

Can someone suggest how can i talk about it without people thinking that i am an asshole?",1
"Doesn't it feel like it's harder to find people who just enjoy civilly sharing ideas they disagree with? Edit: I think I had a stroke when I typed the title. Sorry folks. Haha 

I live in Virginia, USA. I live in a large city with a diverse population. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm not just talking about Reddit or the internet. It's especially difficult in real life and seemingly becoming more rare. I'm not a perfect example; but I'm working on it. 

In terms of in real life.. It seems more and more people are shying away from just having some difficult or challenging conversation civilly just for the sake of learning and growth or even shooting it with someone with different ideas. Not just on hot topics or politics, in general. 

There are many people like this of course, some I call good friends.. But it just feels like these people are getting fewer and far between. Anyone else feel this way?",0
"A smoker I walked past the other day was super considerate. He stopped smoking and held the cigarette behind him until I walked completely past him. I was honestly blown away by this guy. Usually, smokers don’t really care who they smoke around. Also, I usually don’t really notice since I see it often and don’t pay any mind. However, this dude really stuck out. Not only was it super considerate, but it was so unlike any smoker I’ve ever seen. I imagine this dude is very nice person, and it just sucks that he smokes. Hope he’s doing well, wherever he may be. 

Edit: Someone mentioned that my comment (sucks that he smokes) made it out to seem like smoking is “immoral.” That was not my intention. I just think it’s a shame that such nice people have this addiction. Losing an uncle to lung cancer at 50, and another at 60 from a heart attack (following a stroke from cigs), was such a darn shame. That’s why I hope this guy is doing well and lives a long life. It’s all I can really hope for.",1
"I'm going to touch real snow for the first time in my life and I'm so excited! I live in a tropical country and I've never experienced snow before. I've been to countries during their colder seasons but the closest I've got to seeing natural snow so far is some dirty, melting remnants on the hotel window ledge.

By some stroke of luck, I'm going for a 2-week trip to Switzerland with my dad and grandma and one of the places we're going to is the Alps, or more specifically, to the Schilthorn summit!

Whenever I think about it, I get so happy and excited!! I feel like I'll dive headfirst into nature's cocaine when I see it. Sometimes I panic thinking about it because I don't know what to expect.

If you've experienced snow before, could you describe it to me?",1

After a massive eczema flare up I had 2 years ago, I wouldn't normally wear anything outside the house that showed more than half of my forearms because of the bad eczema scars + hyperpigmentation covering my arms. But last week (I forgot to post this) I thought fuck it, I'm not dying of heat stroke during this heat wave. I went to work and nobody gave a shit about the scars on my arms so why should I.

"My roommate just cut a watermelon Wow.

I don't know why, but today was such a great day. The last one that was so good is quite some time ago. I'm in Australia at the moment and feel like I'm wasting my time, but today was a really good day. The weather was shit which meant I can finally wear clothes with long sleeves again without dying of a heat stroke, which is pretty neat. 

Now I'm sitting on the couch watching TV, exploring Reddit, listening to music, and I was thinking about how I don't even deserve this happiness because I'm such a lazy piece of ass, but then my roommate asked me if I wanted some watermelon, and SOMEHOW that made me really happy.

"Back to old hobbies I'm very stressed about money and debts and due dates and what not so this morning I decided to go back to some stuff I used to do and grabbed my color pencils and a coloring book. Did a few strokes but is something I plan to retake until finishing my page. I stopped coloring after a severe mental breakdown that lasted months on 2018 and I was quite happy with how I was growing before that so this was a rust off session to say something. After being bored with the colors I opened up a 1K puzzle and I was flowing so smoothly while doing it. Not to brag but I am quite good at them as ive build em a lot when younger and I was really happy all along showing my boyfriend my advances on both activities. I'm still stressed, I'm still a tad worried and uncomfortable with the money and the world but, it was fun to go back to these things.

She was almost hysterical and hyperventilating.

I gifted her a sketchbook and a bunch of colourful pens, hoping that she might eventually draw something and she did! I’m really happy, because we are going through a really rough time (my father had a stroke three years ago and she does all she can to cover his medication and take care of him (on top of that she beat breast cancer!!)) so seeing her draw after so much time really warms my heart. She has been to Art School, then studied in an Arts Academy and I’m following her steps as an artist myself. :-)

The doctor immediately wanted to prescribe medication, but I pushed back and said I would work to lower it naturally.  So, I cut way back on cheese and red meat, and I started including more heart-healthy options into my diet. I went to the doctor last week to follow up, and this time my cholesterol was 203! I still plan to work on lowering it, but it’s no longer considered high. I’m pretty damn proud of myself, especially since heart disease and strokes run in my family.",2

It was a bit rocky at the start but I was doing great. I drove all the way to the end of the park and back. I was about to pull into a parking lot when I saw a park ranger and had a stroke trying to figure out what he was going to do. Was he making a U turn? Was he parking? We'll never truly know.

Also on the way to the park we got McDonald's.",1

My bf is in the hospital after possibly having a mini stroke and I can't visit him. 

My roomie I got close to is leaving for her halfway house tomorrow. So bittersweet

Also met with my parents, had some of mama's food, had a drink with the family and got a load of good news!
My parents finally paid off their mortgage, my bro finally got his bachelor's degree and my nana is recovering well from her stroke. Downside is my phone got stolen during the weekend but I was able to buy a new better, and cheaper phone pretty quick and recover all the data instantly. I am absolutely glad to be me right now.",2

Everything about this show is mesmerizing. His calm voice and confidence, how comforting he is about how you should paint the way you want and you're not going to fuck everything up, the way he turns a few seemingly random brush strokes into a thing of beauty.

I mean. He raises squirrels and brought them on the show. And he'll just bring up random people who work for the show and just talk about how amazing they are. He doesnt need to do that. He just does. I want to be more like him. ",1

Mostly she has no problems with it but this past Thursday she had a seizure bad enough that the doctors thought they'd have to sedate and intubate her.

After a few days in the hospital she's good as new, but we had some issues. I asked 
r/epilepsy not really expecting a response because normally things that I post don't seem to get much attention.

But the people in r/epilepsy really came through answering my questions and sending well wishes to my mom. It was a really nice surprise and I feel better knowing that there's somewhere to turn for help.

For reference, I watched Season 29, Episode 1; or 'island in the wilderness'.",1

There wasn’t anything I could do, and she was hours away from me, so I just had to just stay up and wait until I received the call. I’m not writing this for sympathy, but it made me realize something I wanted to share.

Go out today and tell your loved ones that you love them. When you imagine someone passing away, you vision it being a peaceful period of time that gives you time to tell them your final goodbye. However, it doesn’t always happen like that. So today, tell them you love them, and tell them how they have made a positive impact on your life. It’ll make their day, and it’ll possibly make you glad you did it later down the road.

Life isn't so bad. I moved to California 6 months ago to be with my girlfriend and pursue my dreams of being a wrestler all at age 18 and it was hard but I was doing that! But tragedy struck when I got the news my mom and siblings were in a car accident but they ended up okay for the most part but then I was told my dad had a stroke while in prison a day after that and it shook me up but 2 days after my grandma lost her battle to cancer and it sent me into a depression I've never felt and on top of that the place I was living in hit me with a contract termination for taking in a cat just a week prior so that sucked bad.

He’s clearly saying this in an ironic manner. However, drinking moderately is actually beneficial. It can help prevent heart disease, strokes, and even certain types of cancer. So it’s doubly ironic because Luda doesn’t realize what he’s saying is literally true.

Last night, she took 4 different containers of peanut butter and combined them into one. Creamy, chunky, etc... all mixed up. My daughter HATES chunky peanut butter, and is a diabetic, and peanut butter is her go-to snack when she's recovered from a low and wants to even out her blood sugar (sugar+protein+fat=happy diabetic). Last night after treating a low, there was no peanut butter she could eat, and my mom's answer was ,""Too bad!"".

I know nobody's face is 100% symmetrical but I feel like most people's faces are pretty comparable when viewed from both sides, but for whatever reason I feel like the left side of my face is like, a 7/10 and the right side is a 2/10. I don't think I've ever had a stroke that I know of, haha, but the right side of my face just...droops in a way that I can't explain, and I hate it. Not enough to pay to get it fixed, but just enough that I try to avoid having photos taken from that side.

Anyone else know this feel?",1
"So in my area, we have this really famous cat that stays at one exact place right next to a supermarket in the shade He's a fat ginger cat who just sits, sleeps, and feeds there and pretty much has made it his home, seems pretty satisfied with his life, roaming around the neighborhood, and loves being pet and stroked on the belly by random people who always recognize him when he walks by. The community even has a Facebook fan group dedicated to him.

The sad part is that the whole community's  got really worried because the place he takes shelter in was getting demolished(used to be a popular hangout for everyone  because it was right next to our school, and was like sort of a town centre with a gym and coffee shop and everything), so we're all looking to get him adopted.

"I wrote a little poem (Fixed format... maybe) Yet as my flesh is torn by bitter rats,
Do I pity the befeallen stars.

Brushed away by the newly risen,
Splashed over by shades of pink.

Revealing the chilled structures,
Where the growth begins. 

As I lay in the open field,
As the grass strokes my tender skin,
My thoughts ooze into the cracked Earth,
Fertilizing the blossoming flowers.

Do they grow through my still body? 

And as the sun greets my rough face,
Does a smile return the favor? 

Oh, as the snow melts!

How I welcome thee!

And praise the raising violets.
Oh, how the sun rises in my heart
And the clouds wrap me in comfort 
As the spring yields,
Does all change 
And all rests.

After the stretching,
Does all maintain. 

Until again cold reaches once more.
Blossoming grows 
And do the flowers bring about 
The necessary changes.",1

Then all of a sudden there was a loud ringing in my right ear and I think a static noise too. I lost some feeling in my right side of my face (felt kinda numb). My eyes kept going cross eyed. All I could think was Wtf is happening, Dont faint dont faint, am I going to die, is this a seizure or stroke, and I pulled myself together to take a drink of water. At one point I thought I was going to faint but caught myself right before it and it shortly went away, although the ringing stayed for a but just less intense.

Id never had anything like that happen, and as far as I know I dont have some disease. Also things were normal all week.

Any idea on what happened? I think it may be Tinnitus or something like that.",2
"So my dad just had a stroke So my dad just had a stroke this morning around 6:30 and was driven from his work home, my step-mom drove him to the ER where they told him he had a miniature stroke (so nothing too bad or permanent) but he was told to go to another hospital ER about a mile away. He's currently there getting tested and we don't know if he is going to be staying the night or not and we are not allowed to visit him (because of COVID) so I went with my aunt in town to go change his tire and oil like I was supposed to today.

Edit: My dad is only 51 and turns 52 in September but he has had a feeling for the past year that he might have a stroke at anytime because he has a lot of migraines (which is a sign that you might have a stroke) but there was no permanent damage from what I understand and he is currently staying the night.",2

You had a stroke two months earlier but still, you're that Superman who healed up from that dad and again started working for me to feed me well. Who am I to waste your money on a girl where I don't know if she's destined to marry me or not. I should have cared you much better. You never judged me by my standard.

I've already accepted that I will never be able to achieve penetration in my life (not that I would be able to get with a girl anyway). I'm 18 and I'm pretty sure it's not going to grow any more. When I masturbate I can't even stroke up and down on my dick, I kinda just jiggle it around and it gets me off. So yeah. There's my confession.

"I feel guilty ever since my grandfather passed away First off all, excuse my English.

So me and my gradfather were really close. He was my rock in a world where I didn't count on my dad. He was working in another country so I've been raised more by my grandparents and my mom. 

When I was 14 (6 years ago) one day he asked me to take a walk with him. We always went on walks at least once or twice a week. The stuck up teen I was I said no which is the biggest mistake of my life. That was the day he had a stroke and went into a coma. He was already sick (he had no kidneys and had to go to the hospital reguralry).

If I went with him, he could've gotten the treatment he needed way sooner and he could still be alive. This still keeps me awake at night.

Nobody knows about this but I've been thinking of telling it to my mom (his daughter) but nothing good will come out of it.

I have a stupidly  stressful job. It's customer service so there's a decent amount of angry people to deal with. There's also a good amount of high-pressured sales.

I can't let myself be completely vulnerable and reliant on my husband, because of him. I obsessively watch my security camera when home alone, because of him. 

He allegedly had a stroke a week ago (he often makes up/exaggerates illness to manipulate people), and honestly, I am ok with the idea of him dying. He's a truly evil person for many more reasons than listed above. Being at his viewing would give me such a sense of peace and safety...

Some of them want to sniff her dirty panties, others just want to stroke into them.  Some of them bring their own s/o's panties to share with me, others don't (doesn't matter to me, I'm more into them using hers).  Sometimes I stroke or suck them, and sometimes they do me.

Is there a specific mechanism of why one is better for each respective disease? Maybe because in persistent afib or valvular disease the mechanical events causes platelet aggregation thus an anti platelet is more appropriate and effective? 

What about DVT/PE. A PE is usually from a thrombotic emboli and DVT perhaps from just blood stasis and hypercoaguability states causing an embolic event thus the anti coagulation is more effective? 

Interestingly, both are approved for ACS according to epocrates. 

Would like a more sophisticated and concrete evidenced based mechanism explanation if possible rather than my theory-craft.

Guidelines would suggest a CT brain scan first to rule out intracranial hemorrhage, but why don't we proceed with an MRI directly instead?

2) Same scenario as above, except the CT scan is performed and is generally unremarkable. The patient still has L arm weakness suggestive of an ischemic stroke. Is it acceptable here to give tPA without peforming an MRI first in the interest of time, because we're around the 3-6h mark? If not, why not?

However, the three specialties have hugely different salaries. This procedure is most often done in large academic hospitals where the physicians are salaried. Why would a hospital have neurosurg/IR do the procedure when the neurologist whose salary is 1/3 can do it?

Similarly, do neurologists who acquire additional training for this procedure make significantly more than their other neurologist colleagues? Looking at public databases, it doesn't appear that vascular neurologists do.

"Here it goes. I don’t know who I am. I had a brain injury at 16, with a coma, 2 strokes and by a miracle, I never had any problems jumping back to life until last year. I was diagnosed with epilepsy disorder, so naturally being a mom losing her license was a huge slap in the face for me. Especially for everything I fought for... I have 2 little kids whom I love so much, who have kept me on this earth, tbh. I try to cope with all of the things... appointments, school, dinners, playing, reading, homework, cleaning... but it seems like I don’t get a chance to be ME. Maybe I never will. Maybe this is just my life now at 35. I don’t know what makes me ME anymore. Battling all these issues I have lost my identity. 

Has anyone experienced this in some fashion?? It’s hard to explain but I just want to feel like I’m not freaking alone.",2
"Why do I function so well during actual crisis (e.g. medical crisis) and panic during during non-emergency crises (premier not invited to specific conference)? I’ve been in situations where I’ve witnessed car crashes, my best friend’s dog had a stroke, my colleague had a heart attack, my mother ODed and I’ve been confident, calm and in control. Called appropriate authorities, delegated tasks to other people etc.

But things like getting word from Cabinet that we didn’t invite the premier to an event they thought he should have been invited to will totally freak me out, or my neighbour thinking my apartment looks messy, or CRA saying that they’re auditing me when I have the worlds most boring tax return.

Why is this?",1
"Trazodone and fainting Has anyone else been on trazodone and it's caused them to faint? I took my pills last night, 150mg, went to bed, then I decided to get up to make a snack. This led to me getting very dizzy and feeling very weak, so much so that I had to sit on the floor in my kitchen. I don't know how long I was sitting there, but when I gained my senses back a bit, I realised I was sitting on the floor in my kitchen, and that it should go back to my bed. I had the strangest buzzing sensation in my head and a ringing in my ears. I felt like I was having a stroke. It wasn't nice.

Can anyone relate to this? I had a look online and that can be considered to be a severe reaction to trazodone.",1

My wife is an extreme hypochondriac and it's mentally draining for both of us. How can I help her? As the title says my wife is an extreme hypochondriac. She spends almost every single day freaking out about some illness that she suddenly has even though she has absolutely nothing that would show that she does. Examples like a slight neck pain after sleeping wrong is meningitis. A stomach ache is appendicitis. Pretty much anything else? She's having a stroke. It's a constant battle of me trying to convince her that she doesn't have <random illness> and I'm exhausted by it as much as she is. I want to be able to help her but nothing I say makes any difference and and I cant help but get angry at this point which I'm trying desperately to not do. What can I do to help her?,2
"How to prevent phantom symptoms due to hypochondria? Okay so I (23f) have a lot of health anxiety, and when I learn about symptoms I convince myself I have them. For example I thought my cat had lice and then my head became very itchy because I was convinced I got lice from my cat (not possible) or I convinced myself I was going to have a stroke because of a head ache, so the whole left side of my face felt tingly and slight weak for 30 minutes until I calmed down. Obviously it wasn’t a stroke and my brain just creating the placebo. Or I read about bed bugs once and my whole body itched for days even thought I had someone check my apartment for them and I knew they weren’t there. But even when I’m aware my body is basically faking the symptoms they still linger for a bit. 

What can I do to prevent this? I hate dealing with it.",1

The past year or so I’ve felt like I’m driving down a long stretch of road and hit every single red light along the way. Multiple strokes of bad luck has lead me to feeling numb and sad. I don’t really know how to cope because most of the ways I’ve coped in the past (exercising/spending time outside, spending time with friends, etc.) are impossible to do at the moment.

I was searching for any kind of hope about the future, so at one day I waked up from my sleep and once I decided that I should talk to my ex to put our problems aside but she replied to me in a hurting way and suddenly after our conversation, I developed some sort of severe headache in my left hemisphere, left eye lid twitches with severe stabbing eye pain also in my left eye, abdominal cramps and pain after which all subsided in a few seconds with cold sweating on my face then I I couldn’t sleep for the following couple of days then I went for a psychologist and I am on medication for depression now but I really want to know what are these symptoms is this a stroke or something?

"Can we talk about how physical depression and anxiety are? I feel like there isn't enough information and conversation out there about the fact that depression and anxiety literally feel physically like other diseases and that there are people out there thinking they're having heart attacks, strokes, MS, etc. but really it's just that anxiety and depression are that bad that they mimic those symptoms sometimes.

My best friend’s grandfather suffered a stroke on my birthday. I have this irrational worry that something bad would happen and I would be deeply hurt again.

2. Also this feeling that another year has passed, I haven’t achieved anything remarkable in my life. I’m still fairly young (23), but I can’t stop feeling that I’m just a disappointment to myself and other around me.

"I fell asleep for nearly 36 hours. Did wake and talk during, but I have no memory of it. Foggy memory in general now, and just a strange sense of self if that makes sense. I’m worried I’m about to have a stroke or something. I just remember falling asleep like normal, I just woke up and was told I missed an entire day. My boyfriend said I was mean, and told him I was going to be sick - but I don’t remember. 

I still feel like things are a little off. I feel a little shakey and anxious and weak. I feel like things may taste a little bit different. It’s really hard for me to describe. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this before? I went to the ER and got a CT scan and that didn’t show anything. I was told I have a UTI which could cause confusion, but I feel like that’s quite a stretch. 

My mom had a brain aneurysm, so did my grandma, and my sister did as well. But then I think - maybe it was just stress or anxiety and getting worked up about it is going to make it happen again.",1

It really stroke me few days ago, it was my birthday and two of my friends came to my home and we spent entire day together, I didn't invited them, they just came to me becose they like me. I very enjoyed their presence but there was a thoughts at the back of my head like ""why are doing it"" ""why do they care about me"" ""it seems suspicious"". After they left I couldn't stop thinking about it, ""this are my best friends, so why do I feel weird?"".

Few days passed and I'm still thinking about it, I would like to put my entire trust in them but for some reason I can't. I feel guilty about it. 

It does not limit to close relations, I feel it when grandma gives me cash, or someone says ""hello"" first etc.

I called my dad and talked to him to keep myself alert and to make someone aware of my situation. I’m at my SO’s house, I have taken Passion Flower to calm myself and have rested a while.

I went to the ER just to have things checked out and the doctor ordered a CT scan. I was still dehydrated after drinking at home and they wouldnt give me water after asking.

Feeling bad for strangers Today I went to Home Depot for a few things and as I was waiting to check out I hear a women in panic. I saw a women laying on the floor. I’m pretty sure she was having a stroke. In that moment I froze. Personally I don’t handle emergency situations well. I’m always thinking of worse case scenarios even if it’s a simple fever. I felt so bad that I couldn’t do anything that when I left I moved my car close to a spot where I can see the ambulance. I sat until I watched her go into the ambulance and her (what I was sure is her daughter) looked a bit calmer.

I need help Does anyone kinda get weird sensation in your left arm when you get anxiety.. its like its weak. Also I wake up not breathing sometimes. Constantly checking my heart rate. I pray every night i live another day. I dont have any friends so i cant talk to anyone about my anxiety.

I also have night panic attacks a few times a week were I jolt up out of sleep feeling like my heart is about to explode grabbing my heart rate monitor. This has been going on for a year and 6 months. I have anxiety about  having an heart attack or stroke and it makes it worse. I've spent so much money to fix this like bath supplies and cbd items.. I've got supplements and stopped my drinking. when my arm feels weird I put icy hot on it to distract me from stroke possibilities... Idk the answers to my problem but please if someone knows how to fix me... please let me know. :/,1

"How to deal with suicidal thoughts & stress I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts for years, I can’t actually tell you when they started honestly. But recently they’ve been 1,000x worse than before. I am a college student working on my thesis so I know the increase of them is from stress, but I don’t know how to deal with them. 

Last semester in October the same thing started happening, as well as somatic symptoms that had me forcefully taken to a hospital to ensure I didn’t have a stroke. I’m extremely worried that might happen again this semester, and I really don’t want to go through that again.

Of all the drugs I've done in the past caffeine is the only drug I've never managed to kick. In defense of myself caffeine is a very mild drug compared to other drugs I might have succumbed to and either died or had a very different life.

Still, I'm kicking the habit but my intention is not forever. I want to continue drinking coffee on **my** terms. As in, when I feel like having some not every day an hour or so after I wake up.

I started drinking coffee at 23 and now I am 50.

So fellow grown-ups of reddit. What is your relationship with this wonderful addictive drink? I am subbed to r/coffee but I don't think this is a good question for that sub.

Have you kicked it? Were you never addicted in the first place? Am I fooling myself thinking I can quit and dabble as I see fit?

No. Wrong answers left and right. 

I finally gave up and  used the ""Help Me Solve This"" button. I basically plugged in my numbers and didn't learn a goddamn thing. I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. I just want the grade and I'll tr and reverse engineer it later.

I gave in too late though, and ran out of time. I got a 36% on this weeks My Accounting Lab homework. This caused my to cry for the past hour. I'm so frustrated and tired and I really want to quit.

It is not symmetric at all. I think team comps should start from the inside to out, not going to the right. Just as the bans. It looks weird that the first 3 bans for the left team are not in the middle where the last 2 bans are. Green and red squares to change places. What are your ideas?",0
